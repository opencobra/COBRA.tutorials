%% 3. Flux Balance Analysis
% Flux balance analysis (FBA) is used to calculate the flow of metabolites through 
% a metabolic network making it possible to predict an organism's growth-rate 
% or the production-rate of a bioproduct. Combining the stoichiometric matrix 
% and the objective function can create a system of linear equations that can 
% be used to calculate the fluxes through all the reactions in the network. In 
% flux balance analysis, these equations are solved using linear programming algorithms 
% that can quickly identify optimal solutions to large systems of equations. 
% 
% Once the external conditions have been set, which include 1) defining the 
% allowed carbon sources, 2) defining the oxygen uptake level, and 3) setting 
% the objective function, then the simulation conditions are setup to perform 
% FBA. This is accomplished through the use of the "optimizeCbModel(model,osenseStr)", 
% a COBRA toolbox function where the first argument is the model name and the 
% second argument determines if the optimization algorithm maximizes ('max') or 
% minimizes ('min') the objective function. Below is an example for an aerobic 
% environment with glucose as the carbon source optimizing for maximum growth-rate. 
% _[Timing: Seconds]_

model = e_coli_core; % Starting with the original model
model = changeRxnBounds(model,'EX_glc(e)',-10,'l'); % Set maximum glucose uptake
model = changeRxnBounds(model,'EX_o2(e)',-30,'l'); % Set maximum oxygen uptake
model = changeObjective(model,'Biomass_Ecoli_core_w_GAM'); % Set the objective function
FBAsolution = optimizeCbModel(model,'max') % FBA analysis
%% 
% ?FBAsolution? is a Matlab structure that contains the following outputs.  
% ?FBAsolution.f ? is the value of objective function as calculated by FBA, thus 
% if the biomass reaction is the objective function then ?FBAsolution.f" corresponds 
% to the growth-rate of the cell. In the example above, it can be seen that the 
% growth-rate "FBAsolution.f" is listed as 0.8739 $<math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" 
% display="inline"><mrow><msup><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">hr</mi></mrow><mrow><mo>?</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow></msup></mrow></math>$. 
% ?FBAsolution.x? is a vector listing the calculated fluxes flowing through the 
% network. ?FBAsolution.y? and ?FBAsolution.w? contain vectors representing the 
% shadow prices and reduced costs for each metabolite or reaction, respectively.
% 
% The flux values found in the structure "FBAsolution.x"  can be printed 
% out using the "printFluxVector(model,fluxData,nonZeroFlag,excFlag)" where the 
% second argument is a vector of the flux values, the nonZeroFlag only prints 
% nonzero rows (Default = false), and excFlag only prints exchange reaction fluxes 
% (Default = false). Examples of printing non-zero fluxes and exchange reaction 
% only fluxes are shown below. _[Timing: Seconds]_

printFluxVector(model,FBAsolution.x,true) % only prints nonzero rows
printFluxVector(model,FBAsolution.x,true,true) % only print exchange reaction fluxes 
%% 
% Printing all the zero and nonzero fluxes can be achieved using "printFluxVector(model,FBAsolution.x)."

%% 4. The Subsystems of the _E.coli _Core Model
% Now with these basic Matlab and COBRA toolbox skills behind us, it is time 
% to start exploring the subsytems that make up the _E.coli_ core model. We will 
% start by looking at the "energy production and management" section of the model 
% that is referred to as the "oxidative phosphorylation" subsystem in this core 
% model. This subsystem is located in the upper right corner of the _E.coli _core 
% map as shown below in Figure 8.
% 
% 
% 
% *                                                Figure 8.* The location 
% of the energy management subsystem and it's reactions highlighted in blue on 
% the _E.coli _core map [3].
% 
% As you will see in this section, this subsystem not only includes the reactions 
% for oxydative phosphorylation, it also includes reactions that are required 
% for managing the reducing power needed in the cell. This subsystem will be followed 
% by an exploration of the glycolysis pathway, the pentose phosphate pathway, 
% the tricarboxylic acid cycle, the glycoxylate cycle, gluconeogenesis, and anapleurotic 
% reactions, fermentation pathways, and the nitrogen metabolism.
% 
% *4.A. Energy Production & Management*
% 
% Perhaps the most important requirement of an operational cell is the production 
% and management of energy and reducing power. There are two main mechanisms available 
% within the _E.coli_ core model for the production of ATP (atp[c]) energy: 1) 
% substrate level phosphorylation, and 2) oxidative phosphorylation through the 
% use of the electron transport chain. Substrate level phosphorylation occurs 
% when specific metabolic pathways within the cell are net producers of energy. 
% In these cases, atp[c] is formed by a reaction between ADP (adp[c]) and a phosphorylated 
% intermediate within the pathway. In the core model this occurs in the glycolysis 
% pathway with both phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK), and pyruvate kinase (PYK),_ 
% _and in the_ _tricarboxylic acid cycle with succinyl-CoA synthetase (SUCOAS). 
% Through these substrate level phosphorylation enzymes each molecule of glucose 
% can potentially add four molecules to the total cellular flux of atp[c]. 
% 
% The second mechanism for energy generation is oxidative phosphorylation 
% through the electron transport chain, which under aerobic conditions, produces 
% the bulk of the cell's atp[c]. In the simple core model, the electron transport 
% chain is used to transport protons (h[c]) from the cytoplasm across the cytoplasmic 
% membrane into the extracellular space (periplasmic space in actual cells) to 
% create a proton-motive force which drives ATP synthase (ATPS4r) to produce atp[c]. 
% 
% 
% 
% *                                                                        
% Figure 9. *Oxidative Phosphorylation and Transfer of Reducing Equivalents [3].
% 
% _*Aerobic Respiration*_
% 
% For aerobic respiration, the primary source of atp[c] is produced through 
% oxidative phosphorylation. This is illustrated in Figure 9 where NADH (nadh[c]), 
% acting as a substrate for NADH dehydrogenase (NADH16), provides the reducing 
% power necessary to trigger the electron transport chain. The _E. coli _core 
% model combines the electron transport chain into two reactions. In the first 
% of these two reactions, NADH16_ _catalyzes the oxidation of nadh[c] to form 
% NAD+ (nad[c]) while extracting four protons (h[c]) from the cytoplasm. It then 
% transports three protons to the extracellular space while combining the fourth 
% proton with a proton and two electrons from NADH to transform ubiquinone-8) 
% (q8[c]) to its reduced form ubiquinol-8 (q8h2[c]). Both q8[c] and q8h2[c] are 
% oil soluble coenzymes that can diffuse freely within the lipid environment of 
% the cytoplasmic membrane allows q8h2[c] to eventually transfer its two electrons 
% and two protons to cytochrome oxidase (CYTBD). The two protons (h[e]) are then 
% transferred into the extracellular space where they add to the proton-motive 
% force. The two electrons from q8h2[c] are then combined with two cytoplasmic 
% protons and an oxygen atom, the terminal electron acceptor, to form water. In 
% this model, oxygen (o2[c]) spontaneously diffuses from the environment into 
% the cell through the spontaneous 02t reaction. 
% 
% With a proton-motive force now created by the pumping of protons from the 
% cytoplasm to the extracellular space, the reaction ATPS4r_ _can synthesize atp[c] 
% from adp[c]. For this simple model the _P_/0 ratio is stoichiometrically set 
% to 1.25. Another reaction included in the energy management suite is adenylate 
% kinase (ADK1), a phosphotransferase enzyme that catalyzes the interconversion 
% of adenine nucleotides, and plays an important role in the adp[c]/atp[c] balance 
% or cellular energy homeostasis.
% 
% Finally, the ATP maintenance function (ATPM), which is set at 8.39 $<math 
% xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mi mathvariant="normal">mmol</mi><mo 
% stretchy="false">?</mo><msup><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">gDW</mi></mrow><mrow><mo 
% stretchy="false">?</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow></msup><mo stretchy="false">?</mo><msup><mrow><mi 
% mathvariant="normal">hr</mi></mrow><mrow><mo stretchy="false">?</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow></msup></math>$ 
% accounts for the energy (in form of atp[c]) necessary to replicate a cell, including 
% for macromolecular synthesis (e.g., proteins, DNA, and RNA). Thus, for growth 
% to occur in the _E.coli_ model, the flux rate through ATPM must be greater than 
% 8.39 $<math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mi mathvariant="normal">mmol</mi><mo 
% stretchy="false">?</mo><msup><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">gDW</mi></mrow><mrow><mo

% mathvariant="normal">hr</mi></mrow><mrow><mo stretchy="false">?</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow></msup></math>$. 
% If the model detects that ATPM has not reached its minimum value it will not 
% produce FBA results.
% 
% Another part of the energy management of a cell is the reducing power that 
% is required for both cellular catabolism and anabolism. Catabolism refers to 
% a set of metabolic pathways that break down molecules into smaller units and 
% release energy. For this core model, nadh[c] provides the reducing power necessary 
% for the catabolic activities of the cell. 
% 
% Anabolism, on the other hand, is the set of metabolic pathways that construct 
% molecules from smaller units. These anabolic reactions are endergonic and therefore 
% require an input of energy. In this case, NADPH (nadph[c]) is the reducing power 
% required for biosynthesis using the cell?s precursor metabolites. 
% 
% Maintaining the proper balance between anabolic reduction charge, nadph[c]/ 
% nadp[c], and catabolic reduction charge, nadh[c]/ nad[c], is achieved by reactions 
% catalyzed by transhydrogenase enzymes, as shown in Figure 9. Using the proton-motive 
% force, NAD(P) transhydrogenase (THD2) catalyzes the transfer of a hydride ion, 
% a negative ion of hydrogen, from nadh[c] to create nadph[c]. The opposite transfer, 
% of a hydride ion from nadph[c], to create nadh[c], is catalyzed by another enzyme, 
% NAD+ transhydrogenase (NADTRHD), but it is not coupled to the translocation 
% of protons. These pair of reactions effectively allow transfer of reducing equivalents 
% between anabolic and catabolic reduction charge.
% 
% Now let's use the COBRA Toolbox to explore the details of the energy managing 
% elements of the _E.coli_ core model. In this tutorial, we will focus on exploring 
% the role of cofactors in a core model that is optimized for growth-rate. There 
% is a good discussion of how to find the maximum cofactor fluxes possible in 
% a COBRA-based model in Chapter 19 of Palsson's book [1]. To start with let's 
% print out a table that includes all the reaction abbreviations, names, and their 
% formulas for the reactions invovled in oxidative phosphorylation and the cell's 
% energy and reducing power management (see Figure 9). _[Timing: Seconds]_

model = e_coli_core; % Starting this section with the original model
energySubSystems = {'Oxidative Phosphorylation'};
energyReactions = model.rxns(ismember(model.subSystems,energySubSystems));
[~,energy_rxnID] = ismember(energyReactions,model.rxns);
reactionNames = model.rxnNames(energy_rxnID);
reactionFormulas = printRxnFormula(model,energyReactions,0);
T = table(reactionNames,reactionFormulas,'RowNames',energyReactions)
%% 
% Although this is a specifc table for the reactions associated with energy 
% management, it illusttrates how you can pull up the full reaction (enzyme) name 
% and formula for any subsystem in the core model. It should be pointed out that 
% although the reactions succinate dehydrogenase (SUCDi) and  fumarate reductase 
% (FRD7) are included in the oxidative phosphorylation subsystem because they 
% are membrane-bound enzymes that interact with the quinone pool, they are a better 
% fit functionally in the TCA cycle, as will be seen later.

% Below in Figure 10 is screenshot showing these fluxes flowing through

% In this figure we can see the electrons from nadh[c] entering the electron transport 
% change at NADH16,  flowing through the quinone pool, and then finding their 
% way to reduce oxygen through CYTBD and O2t. With the proton-motive force in 
% place, ATPS4r can now use that energy to convert adp[c] to atp[c]. We can also 
% see the flux flowing through the dummy reaction ATPM that is used to model the 
% atp[c] load required for cell growth. Finally, THD2, NADTRHD or ADK1 are not 
% required to recycle any of the key energy cofactors.

% section of the _E.coli _core map in aerobic conditions with glucose as the sole 
% carbon source (see Figure 7).
% 
% _*ATP Production*_
% 
% Now let's explore in more detail the production and consumption of atp[c] 
% in the core model. The atp[c] produced by ATPS4r is added to the total cellular 
% atp[c] flux that provides the cell's energy. Remember that in aerobic conditions, 
% atp[c] is produced by both substrate phosphorylation and oxidative phosphorylation. 
% All of the reactions that either produce or consume atp[c] can be found using 
% the "surfNet" COBRA toolbox function.  _[Timing: Seconds]_

surfNet(model, 'atp[c]', 0,FBAsolution.x,1,1)
%% 
% These results show that under aerobic conditions with glucose as the sole 
% carbon source there are four producers of atp[c] within the core model. These 
% include ATPS4r (oxidative phosphorylation) as the primary contributor and PGK, 
% PYK, and SOCAS (substrate phosphoylation) as secondary sources. This also shows 
% the consumers to be GLNS, PFK, ATPM and the biomass function. As we will see 
% later, the atp[c] associated with PFK is required by the glycolysis pathway. 
% The atp[c] used by ATPM must be greater than or equal to 8.39 $<math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"

% to allow the cell to grow. Finally the biomass function shows that 52.27 $<math

% x 59.81) is used for the cell's biosynthesis needs. 
% 
% One of the important concepts associated with these constraint-based steady 
% state models is that the total cell fluxes for key cofactors like atp[c] and 
% adp[c] must be equal. This means that for every atp[c] metabolite that is produced, 
% one adp[c] metabolite will be consumed, but to maintain the mass balance throughout 
% the cell somewhere else in the cell an adp[c] molecule will be created from 
% another atp[c] molecule. Thus, the total cellular atp[c] flux must equal the 
% total cellular adp[c] flux. This can be observed using the COBRA Toolbox function 
% called "computeFluxSplits" as shown below. _[Timing: Seconds]_

[P, C, vP, vC] = computeFluxSplits(model, {'adp[c]'}, FBAsolution.x);
total_adp_flux = sum(vP)
[P, C, vP, vC] = computeFluxSplits(model, {'adp[c]'}, FBAsolution.x);
total_adp_flux = sum(vP)
%% 
% These results show that the amount of atp[c] flux in the cell equals the 
% amount of adp[c] flux. Thus, the adp[c]/atp[c] flux ratio is 1. This is also 
% true for nadp[c]/nadph[c] and the nad[c]/nadh[c] flux ratios. 
% 
% Another way to explore the ATPS4r's ability to produce atp[c] is through 
% the use of robustness analysis [12]. Assuming that the objective function is 
% the biomass function (growth-rate), then the following simulation illustrates 
% that the maximum atp[c] flux that can be supported by ATPS4r under aerobic conditions 
% with glucose as the sole carbon source. _[Timing: Minutes]_

model = changeRxnBounds(model,'EX_glc(e)',-10,'l'); % Set maximum glusose uptake
model = changeRxnBounds(model,'EX_o2(e)',-30,'l'); % Set oxygen uptake
[controlFlux, objFlux] = robustnessAnalysis(model,'ATPS4r',100);
ylabel('Growth-rate (1/hr)');
%% 
% This graph shows the entire capability of ATPS4r when the carbon source 
% glucose has a maximum uptake rate greater than or equal to  -10 $<math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"

% If we start at the left of this of this figure, it can be seen that ATPS4r takes 
% on negative values which implies that instead of producing atp[c] through the 
% proton-motive force, it has become an energy-dependent proton pump removing 
% protons from the cytoplasm and transporting them to the extracellular space. 
% Note that the growth-rate under these anaerobic conditions is small. As the 
% flux through ATPS4r becomes positive it starts producing atp[c] providing the 
% majority of the atp[c] required for aerobic operation. At the beginning of aerobic 
% operation there is a nice linear relationship between the produced atp[c] and 
% the growth-rate. Eventually the growth-rate reaches a maximum of 0.8738 $<math

% that ADK1 has been activated to recycle atp[c] to adp[c]. Since the growth-rate 
% decreases, we would also expect the flux used by the biomass function to decrease 
% along with other parts of the cell by selecting alternate pathways to help absorb 
% the extra atp[c]. This is illustrated in the core metabolic map shown below.

% Note that in this case, the only consumer of nadh[c] is NAD16 which is 
% the beginning of the electron transport chain. The producing reactions, as we

% Note that for this core model, the biomass function is also listed as a producer. 
% Since the biomass function represents all the functionality not included in 
% the core model (e.g. biosynthesis pathways), this implies that NADH would be

% Due to the simplicity of the _E.coli _core model, most of the nadph[c] 
% is consumed by the biomass function (0.873922 x 13.0279 = 11.385) to support 
% the cell's biosynthesis needs. The other consumer is the nitrogen metabolism 
% (GLUDy). On the other hand, nadph[c] is produced by reactions in the oxidative 
% phosphorylation pathways, pentose phosphate pathway, and the TCA cycle. It is 
% worth pointing out that in the larger models, that incorporate most of the cells 
% biosynthesis pathways, the number of reactions consuming nadph[c] could be very 
% large. _[Timing: Seconds]_
% 
% _*Anaerobic Respiration*_
% 
% Now let's turn our attention to anaerobic cell operation. During aerobic 
% respiration, oxygen is the terminal electron acceptor for the electron transport 
% chain, which yields the bulk of atp[c] required for biosynthesis. Anaerobic 
% respiration refers to respiration without molecular oxygen. For anaerobic respiration, 
% _E. coli_ only generates atp[c] by substrate level phosphorylation. Glycolysis 
% results in the net production of two atp[c] per glucose by substrate level phosphorylation, 
% but this is low compared to the total atp[c] production of 17.5 atp[c] per glucose 
% for aerobic respiration [1]. 
% 
% The substrates of fermentation are typically sugars, so during fermentative 
% growth, it is necessary for each cell to support large flux values through glycolysis 
% to generate sufficient atp[c] to drive cell growth. Glycolysis also produces 
% two molecules of nadh[c] for each molecule of glucose [1]. As a result, nadh[c] 
% must be reoxidized by fermentation in order to regenerate nad[c] necessary to 
% maintain the oxidation-reduction balance of the cell. 
%

% source.

% Some of these protons can now be used by THD2 to convert nadh[c], which is not 
% needed for the electron transport chain, into nadph[c] where they can be used 
% for cellular biosynthesis.

% _[Timing: Seconds]_

%% 4.B. Glycolysis Pathway
% Now that we have completed the exploration of the energy management subsystem 
% of the core model, it is time to start looking at the other included subsytems. 
% Glycolysis is the metabolic pathway in the _E.coli _core model that converts 
% glucose and fructose into pyruvate. The free energy released in this process 
% is used to form the high-energy compounds of atp[c] and nadh[c]. The location 
% of the glycolysis pathway on the _E.coli _core map is highlighted in the Figure 
% 13.

% (PDH) is included in the glycolysis subsystem it is functionally a better fit 
% in the "Glycoxylate Cycle, Gluconeogenesis, and Anapleurotic Reactions" subsystem, 
% as described in section 4.E.  
% 
% In addition to providing some atp[c] through substrate phosphorylation 
% (PGK and PYK), the glycolysis pathway also proves a major source of nadh[c] 
% (GAPD) that is used to power the electron transport chain. It also supplies 
% several key precursors needed for the biosynthesis pathways. These precursors 
% include: D-Glucose 6-phosphate (g6p[c]) a precursor for sugar nucleotides, D-Fructose 
% 6-phosphate (f6p[c]) a precursor for amino sugars, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate 
% (g3p[c]) a precursor for phospholipids, 3-Phospho-D-glycerate (3pg[c]) a precursor 
% for cysteine, glycine, and serine, phosphoenolpyruvate (pep[c]) a precursor 
% for tyrosine, tryptophan and phenylalanine, and finally pyruvate (pyr[c]) the 
% precursor for alanine, leucine, and valine [5]. These precursors and their location

% From this table, it can be seen that in all four situations, the flux 
% flows from the carbon source at the top left of the metabolic maps down the

% part of the flux is diverted to the G6PDH2r entrance to the pentose phosphate 
% pathways. For the anaerobic case, the flux is only diverted to the lower half 
% of the pentose phosphate pathway (TKT2) to produce the pentose phosphate pathway 
% precursors. Also note that the flux through GAPD has almost doubled since the 
% number of g3p[c] metabolites leaving the FBA and TPI reaction are double the 
% number of fdp[c] metabolites entering FBA. This is possible since the output 
% of FBA provides both a molecule of g3p[c] and a molecule of dhap[c]. The dhap[c] 
% is rapidly converted to g3p[c] thus creating the effect of doubling the g3p[c]
