%% 4.C. Pentose Phosphate Pathway 
% The primary purpose of the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) is to provide the 
% 4-, 5- and 7-carbon precursors for the cell and produce nadph[c]. The 4-, 5- 
% and 7-carbon precursors include D-erythrose-4-phosphate (e4p[c]), alpha-D-ribose-5-phosphate, 
% (r5p[c]), and sedoheptulose-7-phosphate (s7p[c]), respectively.  The nadph[c] 
% is produced in the oxidative pathway by glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH2r) 
% and phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (GND).
% 
% The location of the reactions associated with the PPP are shown below on 
% the _E.coli _core map in Figure 16.

% There are two distinct phases of the pentose phosphate pathway. The first 
% is the "oxidative phase," in which nadph[c] is generated. Note that the pentose 
% phosphate pathway is not the only source of nadph[c] in aerobic conditions. 
% This was explored using "surftNet" in the energy management section (Section 
% 4.A ).  The second phase of the pentose phosphate pathway is referred to as 
% the "non-oxidative" phase that provides a pathway for the synthesis of 4-, 5-, 
% and 7-carbon precursors in anaerobic conditions. The pentose phosphate pathway 
% reactions and supported precursors are shown in the Figure17 below.

%% 4.D. Tricarboxylic Acid Cycle
% The tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle or the citric acid cycle supports a variety 
% of cellular functions depending on the environment. Under aerobic conditions 
% the TCA cycle operates in a counter-clockwise direction using acetyl-CoA as 
% a substrate to produce three cellular precursors, reducing power nadh[c] and 
% nadph[c], cellular energy atp[c] through substrate phosphorylation, and carbon 
% dioxide (co2[c]). While in the anaerobic condition, only part of the TCA cycle 
% will be used to produce two of the three precursors and the reducing power nadph[c]. 
% The location of the TCA cycle subsystem is shown on the following_ E.coli_ core 
% map (Figure 19).

% The precursors associated with the TCA cyle are shown below in Figure 20.  
% The precursors include; 1) oxaloacetate (oaa[c]) for the biosynthesis of asparagine, 
% aspartic acid, isoleucine, lysine, methionine, and threonine, 2) 2-oxoglutarate 
% or alpha-ketoglutarate (akg[c]) for the biosynthesis of arginine, glutamine,

% Figure 20.* TCA pathway reactions and precursors [3].
% 
% The TCA cycle can be divided into an oxidative pathway and a reductive 
% pathway as illustrated in Figure 19. The oxidative pathway of the TCA cycle 
% runs counterclockwise in the lower part of the cycle, from oxaloacetate (oaa[c]), 
% through 2-oxoglutarate (akg[c]). Under aerobic conditons the oxidative pathway 
% can continue counterclockwise from 2-oxoglutarate (akg[c]) full circle to  oxaloacetate 
% (oaa[c]). The full TCA cycle can totally oxidize acetyl-CoA (accoa[c]), but 
% only during aerobic growth on acetate or fatty acids. 
% 
% Under anaerobic conditions, the TCA cycle functions not as a cycle, but 
% as two separate pathways. The oxidative pathway, the counterclockwise lower 
% part of the cycle, still forms the precursor 2-oxoglutarate. The reductive pathway, 
% the clockwise upper part of the cycle, can form the precursor succinyl-CoA.

% The glycoxylate cycle and gluconeogenic reactions are necessary to allow _E. 
% coli _to grow on 3-carbon (pyruvate) and 4-carbon compounds (malate, fumarate, 
% and succinate). This occurs by avoiding the loss of carbon to carbon dioxide 
% in the TCA cycle (glycoxylate cycle), providing a pathway for generation of 
% glycolytic intermediates from TCA intermediates (anapleurotic reactions), and 
% reversing the carbon flux through glycolysis (gluconeogenesis) to produce essential 
% precursors for biosynthesis.

% associated with the glycoxylate cycle, gluconeogenesis, and anapleurotic reactions 
% [3].
% 
% The anapleurotic reactions (PPC, PPS, PPCK, PPC, ME1, and ME2 ) are interconnecting, 
% reversing and bypassing reactions that replenish TCA cycle intermediates. The 
% glycoxylate cycle (CS, ACONTa, ACONTb, ICL, MALS, MDH, SUCDi and FUM), which 
% includes some TCA cycle reactions, is essential for growth on 3-carbon (pyruvate) 
% and 4-carbon compounds since it can convert the precursor acetyl-CoA into glycolytic 
% intermediates without loss of carbon to carbon dioxide (ICDHyr & AKGDH). Finally, 
% growth on 4-carbon intermediates of the TCA cycle, such as malate, requires 
% that the cell be able to produce phosphoenolpyruvate (pep[c]) for gluconeogenesis. 
% Gluconeogenesis refers to the reversal of flux through the glycolytic pathway. 
% There are two pathways able to fulfill these pep[c] demands. The first pathway 
% involves the conversion of malate (mal[c]) to pyruvate (pyr[c]) by a malic enzyme 
% (ME1 or ME2). This is followed by the synthesis of pep[c] from pyr[c] by phosphoenolpyruvate 
% synthase (PPS)_. _Malic enzyme (ME1_) _reduces one molecule of nad[c] to nadh[c] 
% while converting mal[c] to pyr[c]. A second parallel reaction, ME2 reduces one 
% molecule of nadp[c]  to nadph[c].

% Now it is time to explore the the impact on the cell of these pathways

% 
% During aerobic respiration, oxygen is used as the terminal electron acceptor 
% for the oxidative phosphorylation process yielding the bulk of atp[c] required 
% for cells biosynthesis. Anaerobic respiration, on the other hand, refers to 
% respiration without molecular oxygen. In this case, _E. coli _can only generate 
% atp[c] through substrate level phosphorylation which significantly reduces the 
% amount of atp[c] that can be produced per molecule of glucose. In anaerobic 
% conditions, glycolysis results in the net production of 2 atp[c] per glucose 
% by substrate level phosphorylation. This is compared to the total of 17.5 atp[c] 
% per glucose molecule that can be produced for aerobic respiration [1]. To maintain 
% the necessary energy needed for cellular operation during anaerobic growth, 
% this forces each cell to maintain a large magnitude of flux through the glycolysis 
% pathway to generate the necessary atp[c] to meet the cells growth requirements. 
% This results in a large magnitude efflux of fermentative end products (lactate(lac-D[c]), 
% formate (for[c]), acetate (ac[c]), acetaldehyde (acald[c]), and ethanol (etoh[c])) 
% since there is insufficient atp[c] to assimilate all the carbon into biomass. 
% It should be pointed out that only ~10% of carbon substrate is effectively assimilated 
% into the cell due to the poor energy yield of fermentation.
% 
% There are two main fermentive processes included in the core model; homolactic 
% fermentation and mixed acid fermentation. Homolactic fermentation refers to 
% the conversion of pyruvate to lactate as shown on the bottom left of Figure 
% 26 and includes the reactions LDH_D and D_LACt2 . Mixed acid fermentation is 
% the process that converts pyrvate into a mixture of end products including lactate, 
% acetate, succinate, formate, ethanol and includes the following reactions; PDH, 
% PFL, FORti, FORt2, PTAr, ACKr, ACALD, ALCD2x, ACt2r, ACALDt, and ETOHt2r. It 
% should also be pointed out that the end products of each fermentation pathway, 
% with the exception of acetaldehyde, exit the cell along a concentration gradient 
% and transport a proton from the cytoplasm into the extracellular space.

% 30.* Reactions GRPA relationships, and precursors associated with the nitrogen 
% metabolism [3].
% 
% Note that the precursors supported by nitrogen metaboism are proline and 
% arginine. 
% 
% In this simple model, one of the potential sources of nitrogen is through 
% ammonium which is transported into the cell through a transporter (NH4t). Within 
% the cell there are only two reactions (GLNS, GLUDy) that can also assimulate 
% the needed nitrogen into the cell. This can be seen using the "surfNet" function. 
% _[Timing: Seconds]_

surfNet(model,'nh4[c]',0,FBAsolution.x,1,1)
%% 
% Nitrogen can also enter the cell through the uptake of glutamate or glutamine. 
% As a reminder, the default settings for the core model do not allow any amino 
% acids to enter the core model. To change this you would need to use the "changeRxnBounds" 
% COBRA Toolbox function to allow either glutamate or gluamine uptake capability.
% 
% Both glutamate and glutamine can serve as both carbon and nitrogen sources 
% under aerobic conditions. An example of glutamate serving as both carbon and 
% nitrogen source is shown in the COBRA code and Figure 31 below. _[Timing: Seconds]_

% Figure 31.* A screenshot of glutamate serving as both carbon and nitrogen source. 
% 
% In this figure, it can be seen that glutamate enters the cell in the lower 
% right. It passes through the nitrogen metabolism producing 2-oxogluarate (akg[c]) 
% which then feeds the upper part of the TCA cycle. The anapleurotic reactions 
% and gluconeogenesis support the flux necessary to create the  the 4-, 5- and 
% 7-carbon precursors. Part of the flux from the TCA cycle is also directed to 
% the fermentation pathway precursors in addition to secreting both formate and 
% acetate. 
% 
% The fluxes for this example are shown below: _[Timing: Seconds]_

printFluxVector(model,FBAsolution.x,true) % only prints nonzero reactions
%% 
% Since the normal source of nadh[c] from the glycolysis pathway is not 
% availabe during gluconeogenesis, let's explore where the nadh[c] is produced 
% and consumed. _[Timing: Seconds]_

surfNet(model,'nadh[c]',0,FBAsolution.x,1,1)
%% 
% We can see here that there are many sources of nadh[c] production including: 
% AKGDH and MDH from the reductive pathways of the TCA cycle, the anapleurotic 
% reaction ME1, PDH from the fermentation metabolism, and even with the energy 
% management reactions where excess nadph[c] is converted to nadh[c]. The consumers 
% are primarily NADH16 where it provides the reducing power necessary for the 
% electron transport chain and GAPD which is required for the operaton of gluconeogenesis.
%% 5. Conclusion
% This wraps up the tutorial on the _E.coli_ core model. It has attempted to 
% show how the COBRA toolbox can be used to explore a genome-scale metabolic network 
% reconstruction using the core model as an example. Now with this beginning skill 
% set you can start exploring the larger and more accurate network reconstructions!
