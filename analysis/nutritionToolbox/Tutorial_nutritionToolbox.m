%% INTRODUCTION
% This is a tutorial to show how to use the nutrition toolbox to a) find database 
% equivalents in the USDA [1] or FRIDA [2] databases, b) use the database equivalents 
% to create _in silico_ diets, c) how to set _in silico_ diet constraints on whole-body 
% metabolic models[3], and d) how to connect to the nutrition algorithm[4] to 
% predict dietary changes. A dietary food item is defined as the food items for 
% which the user wants to find database equivalents. A database equivalent here 
% means a food item in either the USDA or FRIDA database that matches the original 
% dietary food item both on keyword and macronutrient composition.

%% PROCEDURE
% _Step 1. Prepare your input files_
% Before we can start using the codebase we need to properly format and fill 
% in the input files.
% 
% The nutrition toolbox uses three input files, one of which is optional. The 
% first input file contains the macronutrient composition and associated reference 
% weight of each dietary food item, referred to as the foodDescription file (you 
% may also use the default values found on the packaging, in which case the reference 
% weight is 100g or equivalent depending on the information available). An example 
% can be found in the file demoFoodDescription.xlsx. We also provide a partially 
% completed file with the macronutrient information already filled in (demoFoodDescriptionEmpty.xlsx), 
% so you can test filling in keywords. The columns in the files are: 
%% 
% * OriginalFoodName - the original name of the dietary food item. This would 
% be the name you, the user, would refer to the dietary food item. It has no influence 
% on the results.
% * KeyWords - semicolon (;) seperated list of words that describe the dietary 
% food item. Ensure that the first keyword is the most descriptive or important 
% as the code uses that in weighting potential database equivalents. E.g., for 
% the dietary food item "red apple", the most descriptive word is apple, so we 
% shall put this as the initial keyword. A method to quickly generate keywords 
% is to separate each word in the original food name with a semicolon.
% * toExclude - semicolon (;) seperated list of key words that exclude results 
% from the database equivalent search.
% * databaseID - semicolon (;) seperated list of database IDs already found 
% through previous iterations of running the algorithm.
% * databaseName - semicolon (;) seperated list of the name of the database 
% corresponinding to the IDs filled in the databaseID column. This is either usda 
% or frida and nothing else.
% * ReferenceWeight(g) - Amount of food consumed (included water weight). It 
% is important to check that the macronutrients you enter correspond to this reference 
% weight. Always given in grams
% * Alcohol(g) - Amount of alcohol reported on the food label.
% * TotalEnergy(kcal) - Amount of energy reported on the food label. IMPORTANT 
% given in KCAL.
% * TotalFibre(g) - Amount of fibre reported on the food label.
% * TotalLipid(g) - Amount of lipids reported on the food label, including both 
% saturated and unsaturated fatty acids.
% * TotalProtein(g) - Amount of protein reported on the food label.
% * TotalStarch(g) - Usually not given on normal food labels, yet included here 
% in case this information is available to the user, e.g., through consulting 
% other sources.
% * TotalSugar(g) - Amount of sugar reported on the food label. Usually it will 
% say Carbohydrates -> of which sugars.
% * TotalWater(g) - Amount of water in the food, usually not given on normal 
% food labels.
%% 
% Notably, total carbohydrates are excluded from the comparison due to inconsistency 
% in definitions across databases and on food labels of dietary food items, specifically 
% whether fibre is included in the total carbohydrate count. Instead, individual 
% carbohydrate components (i.e., sugars, fibre, and starch) are used where available.
% 
% If information for a macronutrient column is not available, leave the cell 
% blank/empty.
% 
% If the label of your dietary food item is given as a volume instead of weight 
% (e.g., /100mL) you will need to convert the volume into weight, e.g., by measuring 
% how many grams the 100mL correspond to, or converting the volume into to grams 
% by using the dietary food item density (if available).
% 
% If a dietary food item is consumed in different quantaties across different 
% diets, you only have to enter it once foodDescriptions file. IMPORTANT is that 
% macronutrients input by the user correspond to the consumed weight (includes 
% water weight)
% 
% The weights consumed are used to to adjust the macronutrients from database 
% equivalents to the same weight consumption as the macronutrients for database 
% equivalents are all given per 100g of food consumed.
% 
% Users should double-check that the macros correspond the reference weight 
% of the dietary food item. I.e., make sure that if the reference wieght is 80g, 
% the standard 100g macronutrient values as reported on food labels is NOT used.
% 
% *The second input file* contains the consumed weight of dietary food items 
% per diet which will be used to create _in silico_ diets, referred to here as 
% the foodsConsumed file. In the foodsConsumed file we will fill in the database 
% equivalents found with the foodDescription file. If a dietary food item is not 
% consumed in a diet, set the weight consumed to 0. A worked example can be found 
% in demoFoodConsumed.xlsx, an example without the database equivalents can be 
% found in demoFoodConsumedEmpty.xlsx. The following columns can be filled in:
%% 
% * originalName - The original food name. This is usefull to double check that 
% the consumed weights per diet are correct and the correct database equivalents 
% are put in place.
% * foodName - The name of the database equivalent, serves as a control to make 
% sure it matches with the original food.
% * databaseID - The ID of the database equivalent - this will be given in the 
% output of step 2 when we find and compare database equivalents.
% * databaseUsed  - The name of the database where the database equivalent is 
% found - this will be given in the output of step 2 when we find and compare 
% database equivalents.
%% 
% *The third input file* contains the macronutrient composition of the full 
% diets and can found in demoOriginalMacroDiet. Each column is a diet with the 
% rows being the relevant macronutrients.
% 
% Then we initialise the COBRA toolbox and set our industrial solver

% Initialise the toolbox
initCobraToolbox();
% Change the solver, can be gurobi, ibm_cplex, tomlab_cplex, or mosek
changeCobraSolver('gurobi');
% _Step 2: Finding database equivalents_
% The first step in making an _in silico_ diet is to find equivalents in databases 
% that have metabolite compositions measured. Here we use both the the U.S. Department 
% of Agriculture, FoodData Central (USDA) database and the National Food Institute, 
% Technical University of Denmark FRIDA (FRIDA) database. The function we use 
% to find database equivalents is _vmhFoodFinder.m_ and is available in the COBRA 
% toolbox. The function takes the following inputs:
%% 
% * templateFilePath *Required* - The full file path to where the input file 
% is stored. IMPORTANT! remember to include a file extension. The demo file for 
% this step is the demoFoodDescription.xlsx file.
% * searchType *Optional* - Method of searching keywords in the food database. 
% Either sequential or cumulative. Explanation about the difference is given below.
% * addStarch *Optional* - Boolean, indicates if additional starch should be 
% added based on the database macronutrients. It will add on additional starch 
% based on the equation starch = total carbohydrates - fibre - total sugars, as 
% starch is often not measured in the USDA database. Defaults to false.
% * databaseType *Optional* - Character, which database should be used either 
% 'usda' for USDA FoodData database or 'frida' for the Danish food institute database. 
% Can be 'mixed' if both databases should be used. Defaults to mixed.
% * maxItems *Optional* - Numeric, value indicating the maximum amount of database 
% equivalents to be analysed for macros. Defaults to 50.
% * outputDir *Optional* - Path to where the output file will be stored. Defaults 
% to [pwd filesep 'NT_Result'] 
% * foodSources2Use *Optional* - Cell of strings, dictates which food sources 
% from the USDA database will be used to find database equivalents. Defaults to 
% {'sr_legacy_food'; 'foundation_food'; 'survey_fndds_food'};
%% 
% There are two search methods employed to find potential database equivalents: 
% sequential and cumulative
% 
% In the sequential search method, the first keyword is used to identify database 
% equivalents containing that keyword, resulting in sub-selection 1. The second 
% keyword is then used to filter sub-selection 1, retaining only those entries 
% that contain the second keyword, thereby producing sub-selection 2. This process 
% continues until all keywords have been used. If the final sub-selection is empty, 
% the results from the second to last sub-selection are used, if applicable.
% 
% In the cumulative search method, each keyword independently generates a sub-selection 
% of database equivalents that contain the respective keyword. All resulting database 
% equivalents are then tallied. Database equivalents with a total count of total 
% number of keywords -1 or more are returned. If no database equivalents reach 
% that threshold, the results for total number of keywords -2 matches are returned.
% 
% To obtain mmol/100g database equivalent for the metabolite content of the 
% databases, we have transformed the original database measurements. These are 
% done in createUSDAdatabase and createFridaDatabase but are not discussed here 
% in this tutorial. The databases contain measured metabolite weights in the format 
% of g (or form thereof) /100g database equivalent. We have converted them into 
% g/100g of database equivalent for easy manipulation and then divided them by 
% the molecular weight (g/mol) of a metabolite to arrive at mol/100g. Finally, 
% multiplication by a 1000 transforms the data into mmol/100g of database equivalent.
% 
% First we will define some of the input arguments

% Path to the input file, change to where the file is on your computer
templateFilePath = 'C:\nutritionToolbox\demoFoodDescription.xlsx';
% Path to where we want our results stored so we can easily find them,
% change to an existing path on your computer
outputDir = 'C:\nutritionToolbox\results';
%% 
% If we want to adjust more input arguments we can define them by pressing enter 
% to add additional lines after line 5, and copy and pasting the input argument 
% we want to alter. Add an equal sign (=) and the new value and end with a semicolon. 
% E.g., if you want to decrease the number of items to be compared, you would 
% put maxItems = 30; underneath line 5.
% 
% To call the function (Note for the demo it will take likely between 10 to 
% 20 minutes for the initial run):

vmhFoodFinder(templateFilePath, 'outputDir', outputDir);
%% 
% If you defined multiple input arguments, add them after outputdir as 'name 
% as defined in the list above' and the variable name where the new value is stored 
% or the value directly. E.g., if you want to adjust maxItems, you can either 
% set ,'maxItems', maxItems if you defined maxItems before OR set ,'maxItems', 
% 30 behind outputdir. The resulting input would look like vmhFoodFinder(templateFilePath, 
% 'outputDir', outputDir, 'maxItems, maxItems); OR vmhFoodFinder(templateFilePath, 
% 'outputDir', outputDir, maxItems, 30);
% 
% The outputs will be stored in a folder called NT_results in the defined directory 
% set in the outputDir variable. If left empty, it will be made in your MATLAB 
% current working directory.
% 
% Four output files will be stored in the NT_results folder
%% 
% * fullComparisonFoodItems.xlsx - The file contains the full comparison for 
% each dietary food item. Dietary food items that had no, or too many, database 
% equivalents have also been indicated. The file can be used to select database 
% equivalents to create _in silico_ diets with.
% * tooManyDatabaseHits.xlsx  - This file contains all the dietary food items 
% that had more than the maximum allowed database equivalents to be compared (set 
% in the maxItems input variable). The columns contain the dietary food items 
% and the rows contain every database equivalent found for that food item. The 
% file can be used to refine the key words used to describe dietary food items, 
% or to populate the toExclude column in the input file.
% * noDatabaseHits.txt  - A list of dietary food items for which no database 
% equivalents were found. For these items, check the spelling of key words, alternative 
% names, or reduce the amount of key words. If that does not help, try to find 
% a database equivalent on VMH.life.
% * topResultsComparisonFoodItems.xlsx - Similar to fullComparisonFoodItems.xlsx, 
% containing only the top 10 results for a more concise overview of the results.
%% 
% Either the fullComparisonFoodItemsn or topResutlsComparisonFoodItems can be 
% used to select database equivalents. The code compares the macros provided by 
% the user for each dietary food item and compares them to the given/measured 
% macros from the database equivalents (so-called database macronutrients) and 
% then uses Euclidean distance to evaluate how similar the two are. The Euclidean 
% distance is given in the SimilarityScore column of these two files. Besides 
% the Euclidean distance, the percentage of the macronutrients as caluted from 
% the metabolites is reported. The measured metabolites are grouped into macronutrient 
% groups and give an indication of how well the macronutrients are represented 
% in measured metabolite content. Database equivalents less similar to dietary 
% food items may be chosen if they have a higher measured metabolite representation 
% in their macronutrients. By choosing the database equivalents that may be less 
% similar to the dietary food item but with a higher measured metabolite representation, 
% it increases the metabolic content of the _in silico_ diets and give more overall 
% information as opposed to choosing database equivalents with lower metabolite 
% representation that might be more similar to the dietary food item.
% 
% For example, if we were to compare  two database equivalents: "Dates, medjool" 
% and "Date", both from the USDA database, the database macronutrient values are 
% near identical. However, "Dates, medjool" has higher percentages of macronutrients 
% covered by measured metabolites than "Date", making it a better choice due to 
% its greater metabolite coverage.
% 
% It is very likely that you will need to perform 2 or 3 runs with updated keywords 
% to obtain suitable database equivalents for each dietary food item. To reduce 
% time, it is recommended to fill in the column databaseID and databaseName for 
% the dietary food items for which appropriate database equivalents have been 
% identified. To improve keyword performance in subsequent runs, users may consider 
% changing the number of keywords, exploring alternative spellings, or naming 
% conventions. Additionally, looking at the tooManyDatabaseHits may help finding 
% keywords for the toExclude column. Alternatively, you can increase the max items 
% compared, set by putting ,'maxItems', x in the function call (where x is the 
% new number of max items compared).
% _Step 3: Generating in silico diets_
% With step 1 and step 2 performed, we can now prepare the second input file, 
% referred to as "demoCreateDiet" here. In step 1,  we already filled in the dietary 
% food items and the consumed weight per diet in the "demoCreateDiet" file. Now 
% we can fill in the database id and database name for each dietary food item. 
% The two fields can be directly copied from fullComparisonFoodItemsn or topResutlsComparisonFoodItems 
% where the relevant database equivalents were chosen. Once completed, we can 
% use the function _generateInSilicoDiet.m_ to create our _in silico_ diets and 
% do some quick analyses. The function takes the following inputs:
%% 
% * toCreateDiet *Required*:            Path to the file with the diets that 
% need to be created. consist of column "originalName" where the orignal food 
% names are set. "databaseID" the ID of the fooditem in their database. "databaseUsed" 
% which database was used to find that database equivalent. Each column after 
% is a diet where the values in gram show the dietary food items consumed for 
% each diet. The demo file for this is called 'demoCreateDiet.xlsx'.
% * outputDir *Optional*:                  Path to the directory where the results 
% should be stored. Defaults to current working directory.
% * originalDietMacros *Optional*:   Path to the file with the total macronutrient 
% for the original diets. Should contain the rows lipids, carbohydrate, protein 
% and energy. Defaults to an empty string, i.e., not provided. Template how the 
% file should look like can be found with the name 'demoOriginalMacroDiet.xlsx'.
% * analyseMacros *Optional*:         Boolean, indicates if analysis on macronutrients 
% should be performed. Defaults to true.
% * addStarch *Optional*:                 Boolean, indicates if additional starch 
% should be added based on the database macronutrients. It will add on additional 
% starch based on the equation starch = total carbohydrates - fibre - total sugars, 
% as starch is often not measured in the USDA database. Defaults to false.
%% 
% First let us define our variables

% The path to your diet file. The demo is called demoCreateDiet.xlsx.
% Change to the path where the file is on your computer
toCreateDiet = 'C:nutritionToolbox\demoCreateDiet.xlsx';
% We initialised outputDir in step 2 already. If you want to store it in a
% different directory, remove the % from the code below and put in the
% desired location.
% outputDir = '';

% If you have the macronutrients for the original diets fill the
% demoOriginalMacroDiet.xlsx file and give the path here. If you dont have
% it leave it as is. Change to the path where the file is on your computer.
originalDietMacros = 'C:\nutritionToolbox\demoOriginalMacroDiet.xlsx';
% Put to false if you do not want analysis on the macronutrients
analyseMacros = true;

% Set to true if you want to add on additional starch for USDA based
% database equivalents
addStarch = false;

% Now we can the function
[dietFlux] = generateInSilicoDiet(toCreateDiet, 'outputDir', outputDir, ...
    'originalDietMacros', originalDietMacros, ...
    'analyseMacros', analyseMacros, 'addStarch', addStarch);
%% 
% The figure generated by the code will show you how well various macro-nutrients 
% match the original diet. In blue are the macronutrients calculated from measured 
% metabolites, in orange the macronutrients as measured from the database equivalents 
% and in yellow the database macronutrients from the original diet. From the demo 
% we can see that the database equivalents and the original diet match well in 
% macronutrient composition, with only a slight overestimation of lipid content. 
% We see that the macronutrients calculated from measured metabolites (blue bar) 
% is lower. This is because the metabolite content for every database equivalent 
% is not perfectly represented and some metabolites might be missed or not measured. 
% There are also measurement errors that could play a small role in the deviations 
% we see. 
% 
% Of note: caloric values for database equivalents are extracted from the database. 
% Caloric values for metabolites are assigned based on which macronutrient category 
% a metabolite falls into: lipids are assigned 9 kcal/g macronutrient, protein 
% and sugars 4 kcal/g macronutrient, and alcohol 7 kcal/g macronutrient. Metabolites 
% falling outside these categories are assigned a caloric value of 0 kcal/g macronutrient[6].
% 
% We can look at the first 10 rows of dietFlux and see that indeed the dietary 
% metabolites are returend for the diet that we created. It is normal that not 
% all dietary metabolites have an asocciated flux value as not every metabolite 
% is a) measured or b) found in every database equivalent. The flux values are 
% given in mmol/human/day

dietFlux(1:10,:)
%% 
% All results are stored in the *inSilicoDiet* folder created in the output 
% directory defined at the start with the following files:
%% 
% * fluxDiets.csv - This file contains the flux values for all the dietary components 
% for each diet.
% * macrosCalculatedFromMetabolites.csv - The macronutrients as calculated from 
% the measured metabolites for each diet.
% * macrosAsReported.csv - The macronutrients as reported for all the dietary 
% food items that make up each diet.
% * macroComparison.png - The figure made output by MATLAB, showing the comparison 
% for each diet between the various macronutrients and how well the metabolite 
% macronutrients align with the database macronutrients and, if provided, the 
% original diet macronutrients.
% * energyFractionPerMacro.csv - For the lipids, carbohydrates and the proteins 
% - the fraction of their contribution to the total energy of the diet. Calculated 
% for the metabolite macronutrients, database macronutrients and, if provided, 
% the original macronutrients.
%% 
% These files can be used to gain a deeper understanding of diet. The total 
% metabolite macronutrients (the macronutrients calculated from measured metabolites) 
% compared to the actual measured macronutrients of the _in silico_ diets give 
% an understanding on how well the overall macronutrients are represented by measured 
% metabolites. Comparing the measured macronutrients of the _in silico_ diets 
% and the total macronutrients from the original diet will give an insight as 
% to how well the _in silico_ diet matches the original diet.
%% 
% The file fluxDiets.csv or the output fluxDiets can be used to constrain WBMs 
% with. However we can also use the function _setInSilicoDiet.m_ to easily set 
% the diet with all the correct checks and save them. The function can also check 
% if the WBMs are feasible on the given diet and add on required micronutrients 
% where required. Besides setting the diet altering the dietary exchange reactions, 
% we can also have the WBMs "consume" the database equivalents themselves. In 
% order to do that the toolbox adds in novel reactions to allow for food intake 
% and food breakdown. The food intake is straightforward, as it will be an exchange 
% reaction of the database equivalent (now treated as a metabolite) as in the 
% novel food ([f]) compartment
% 
% foodItem[f] <-
% 
% This allows for database equivalents to enter the WBMs. Then we to breakdown 
% the database equivalent into its metabolite components.
% 
% foodItem[f] -> met1[d] + ... + metx[d]
% 
% Where x is the number of metabolites measured for the database equivalent. 
% We also incorporate macronutrients such as energy and total lipids so we can 
% track them in the diet. The macronutrients here are treated as metabolites. 
% In order to comply with mass balance rules, we need to remove the macronutrients 
% we are treating as metabolites from the system. We do this by setting another 
% exchange reaction.
% 
% macronutrient[d] ->
% 
% With these new reactions in place the WBMs can consume and breakdown databse 
% equivalents into their metabolite components and we can track the total amount 
% of various macronutrients in the diet. The WBM created with database equivalents 
% is referred to as a food item-constrained WBM Important to note is that the 
% food exchange, breakdown, and macronutrient exchange reactions are in g/person/day 
% (kcal/person/day for energy consumption) instead of the usual (mmol/person/day). 
% You can choose either or both options to constrain your WBMs with in _setInSilicoDiet.m_ 
% but we advise to only use the food item-constrained WBMs in conjuction with 
% the nutrition algorithm or to do simulation on diet composition. The additional 
% database equivalent reactions can make the vastly increase the reaction content 
% of the WBMs (by over 30.000 reactions) and make the WBM overly complex for questions 
% that do not involve the optimisation of the actual database equivalents. To 
% study the effect of diet on the various reactions in the human body - we suggest 
% to just use metabolite-constrained WBMs. If no metadata is provided, the function 
% will create both a female and a male WBM for each diet. If metadata is provided 
% the diets will be matched to the corresponding sex-specific WBMs. You also have 
% the possibility to give your own WBMs if you do not want to use the standard 
% Harvey/Harvetta (e.g., community microbiome WBMs). If you have sample specific 
% WBMs, ensure that the sample ID is in the file name of your WBM flanked by underscores. 
% E.g., WBM_sample1_female.mat. If you have altered WBMs that are not sample specific, 
% i.e., one altered male WBM and one altered female WBM, ensure the filename include 
% "_male" and "_female", respectrively. I.e., WBM_altered_male.mat or WBM_altered_female.mat.
% 
% The _setInSilicoDiet.m_ function takes the following inputs:
%% 
% * dietToSet *Required* - Path to the file with the diets that need to be created. 
% Consists of column "originalName" where the orignal food names are set. "databaseID" 
% the ID of the fooditem in a database. "databaseUsed" which database was used 
% to find that database alternative. Each column after is a diet where the values 
% in gram show the dietary food items consumed for each diet. The demo file for 
% this is called 'demoCreateDiet.xlsx'.
% * metadataPath *Optional* - Path to the metadata file, should contain the 
% columns ID, sex and diet. Defaults to an empty string, i.e., not provided.
% * outputDir *Optional* - Path to the directory where the results should be 
% stored. Defaults to an empty string, i.e., not provided.
% * constrainFoodWBM *Optional* - Boolean, indicates if the code should alter 
% WBMs  to 'consume' database equivalents and set the diet as database equivalents 
% instead of dietary fluxes. Defaults to false.
% * constrainFluxWBM *Optional* - Boolean, indicates if WBM should be constrained 
% with the dietary exchange fluxes. Defaults to true.
% * checkFeasibility *Optional* - Boolean, indicates if the newly constrained 
% WBMs should be tested for feasibility. If they are not feasible, dietary exchange 
% reactions are added to try and make them feasible. Defaults to true.
% * wbmVersion *Optional* - If a specific version of the WBMs should be used. 
% Do not start with _. Defaults to an empty string, i.e., not provided.
% * pathToWBMs *Optional* - If non-default WBMs are to be used. Default WBMs 
% are unchanged Harvetta/Harvey. Path to where the WBMs are stored that need to 
% be constrained. If you have sample specific WBMs, ensure that the sample ID 
% is in the file name of your WBM flanked by underscores. E.g., WBM_sample1_female.mat. 
% If you have altered WBMs that are not sample specific, i.e., one altered male 
% WBM and one altered female WBM, ensure the filename include "_male" and "_female", 
% respectrively. I.e., WBM_altered_male.mat or WBM_altered_female.mat.

% were checked, an Excel file named  dietGrowthStats.xlsx is created. The dietGrowthStats 
% file contains WBM feasibility on a rich diet (all dietary metabolites available) 
% and on the constrained diet, as well as the feasibility on the constrained diet 
% with adjustments made try and make infeasibile WBMs feasible. Identified metabolites 
% that restore feasibility in the WBMs are added to the diet in a range of 0.1-10 
% mmol/day/person, depending on which value allows for feasibility. The added 
% metabolites and the fully updated diet can be found in an Excel file called 
% dietGrowthStats in the directory where the WBMs are stored.The feasible WBMs 
% can now be used for modelling purposes. For an indepth tutorial on how to solve 
% WBMs, we refer you to tutorial 2 of Persephone [7]. Here we will further demonstrate 
% how to use WBMs in combination with the nutrition algorithm to predict changes 
% in the diet to achieve desired adjusments in human metabolism.
% _*Step 4: Using the nutrition algorithm*_
% We can use either the food item-constrained WBMs or flux-constrained WBMs 
% with the nutrition algorithm to ask for the minimum changes in diet to achieve 
% to biggest change in chosen reactions in human metabolism. Here we will show 
% three scenarios on how to work with the nutrtion algorithm with food-constrained 
% WBM. The same principles apply for flux-constrained WBMs.
% 
% The nutrition algorithm has 6 inputs:
%% 
% * model - A WBM model
% * obj - the objective function. Usually this is 'Whole_body_objective_rxn' 
% for WBMs or 'Excretion_EX_microbiota_LI_biomass[fe]' for community microbiome 
% WBMs.
% * objMinMax - if the objective function has to be minimised or maximised. 
% Use either 'min' or 'max', respectively.
% * rois - Reactions of interest, a cell array. A list of reactions or metabolites 
% that you want to minimise or maximise and which will be the main drivers to 
% modulate changes in the diet. Metabolites, with their corresponding compartments, 
% will be created as demand reactions. It is important to note that we can at 
% this time only maximimse demand reactions. If existing reactions are picked, 
% double-check the reaction directionality with printRxnFormula.m as it could 
% influence the decision to pick whether to minimise or maximise the reaction.
% * roisMinMax - A cell array of the same size as rois. For every reaction of 
% interest chosen, give 'max' or 'min' to maximise or minimise, respectively. 
% * options - A structure, where every field has an option that modulates how 
% the nutrition algorithm works. We will go over the most relevant options in 
% the various scenarios. For a full list of option please refer to the nutritionAlgorithmWBM.m 
% function description.
%% 
% And outputs the following:
%% 
% * newDietModel - A WBM model, with the updated dietary constraints calculated 
% by the algorithm.
% * pointsModel - The adjusted model used to arrive to the dietary solution.
% * roiFlux - A structure with the solution structures for the original and 
% adjusted diet reaction optimisations of interest .
% * pointsModelSln - The solution structure for the optimisation that found 
% the dietary changes.
% * menuChanges - A table with the changes in database equivalents or dietary 
% metabolites as printed on the terminal.
% * macroChanges - A table with the original and new macronutrient distrubutions 
% and the relative changes between the two.
% * roiChanges - A table with the range of the fluxes carried by the reactions 
% of interest before and after dietary changes, as printed in the terminal during 
% the run.
%% 
% We shall use the food-constrained model created in step 3. Let us assume that 
% we want to find dietary alterations that will result in an a) increase of glucose 
% the in blood, b) increase dopamine in the cerebrospinal fluid, and c) minimise 
% the total lipid intake.
% 
% If we only set these constraints on the system, we will get unrealistic results 
% as we have not set any bounds on how much food is allowed to be removed or added 
% ,or what the allowed ranges in macronutrient composition are. Also, it may happen 
% that the nutrition algorithm will output unrealistic dietary considerations 
% without setting further details (e.g., to optimise dopamine levels, a recommendation 
% may be to supplement a diet by 9kg of egg whites). Therefore, to ensure obtaining 
% realistic dietary changes, we shall use the (optional) "options" variable to 
% constrain our system. There are many options we can set, but the most relevant 
% for us are:
%% 
% * options.foodOrMets - indicates if the dietary changes will be calculated 
% through database equivalents or dietary metabolites. Accepted inputs are 'Food', 
% 'allMets', and 'dietMets'. Food will enable database equivalent calculations. 
% allMets will enable calculation of all dietary metabolites. dietMets will enable 
% calculation of metabolites only found in the the given diets. The default is 
% set to 'Food'.
% * options.roiWeights - numeric array. Indicates the 'importance' of a reaction 
% of interest. The higher the value, the more the dietary solution will be focused 
% on the minimisation or maxisimation of that particular reactions. By default 
% all reactions of interest are weighted with 10.
% * options.caloricRange - a 1x2 numeric array. Specifies what the minimum and 
% maximum range of the consumed calories are allowed to be. It is important to 
% know what the original caloric content of the diet is. If calories of the current 
% diet do not fall within the range you set here, the dietary changes will be 
% altered to fit inside that range. Defaults to [0 1e6].
% * options.carbohydrateRange  - a 1x2 numeric array. Specifies what the minimum 
% and maximum range of the consumed carbohydrates are allowed to be. It is important 
% to know what the original carbohydrate content of the diet is. If the carbohydrates 
% of the current diet do not fall within the range you set here, the dietary changes 
% will be altered to fit inside that range. Defaults to [0 1e6].
% * options.lipidRange - a 1x2 numeric array. Specifies what the minimum and 
% maximum range of the consumed lipids are allowed to be. It is important to know 
% what the original lipid content of the diet is. If the lipids of the current 
% diet do not fall within the range you set here, the dietary changes will be 
% altered to fit inside that range. Defaults to [0 1e6].
% * options.proteinRange - a 1x2 numeric array. Specifies what the minimum and 
% maximum range of the consumed proteins are allowed to be. It is important to 
% know what the original protein content of the diet is. If the proteins of the 
% current diet do not fall within the range you set here, the dietary changes 
% will be altered to fit inside that range. Defaults to [0 1e6].
% * options.sugarsRange - a 1x2 numeric array. Specifies what the minimum and 
% maximum range of the consumed sugars are allowed to be. It is important to know 
% what the original sugar content of the diet is. If the sugars of the current 
% diet do not fall within the range you set here, the dietary changes will be 
% altered to fit inside that range. Important to note is that the lower bound 
% set for sugars CANNOT be higher than the upper bound of the carboyhydrate range. 
% Defaults to [0 1e6].
% * options.foodAddedLimit - A numeric value, specifies how many units of an 
% item (metabolite or food) are allowed to be added to the diet. For database 
% equivalents the unit is in grams, for metabolites it is in mmol. Defaults to 
% 1e6.
% * options.foodRemovedLimit - A numeric value, specifies how many units of 
% an item (metabolite or food) are allowed to be removed from the diet. For database 
% equivalents the unit is in grams, for metabolites it is in mmol. Defaults to 
% 1e6.
% * options.removeFoodItem: A nx2 cell array with the first column being the 
% database equivalent ID and the second column the name of the database of the 
% database equivalents that shall be removed from the analysis.
% * options.addPrice: a nx3 cell array with the first column being the database 
% equivalent ID, the second column the name of the database, and the third column 
% the price (any currency) associated with that database equivalent. Allows for 
% optimising the price of a diet, but only if enough information is available.
%% 
% These constraints, especially the macronutrient ranges, are only interesting 
% when looking at food item-constrained WBMs as metabolite dietary changes will 
% not take those into account. In theory, it is be possible to set the macronutrient 
% range contraints on flux-constrained WBMs where you calculate additional database 
% equivalents. However, the ranges have to be lower as you can only calculate 
% the added macronutrients from the new database equivalents.
%% 
% Now that we know the various inputs and constraints we need to take into account 
% let us put it into practice.

% Load in a food item-constrained WBM. Change to where the file is on your
% computer.
model = load('C:\nutritionToolbox\foodDietWBMs\Diet1_fWBM_male.mat');
%% 
% *IMPORTANT*: To get accurate results, it is imperative that you ensure that 
% the lower and upper bounds of the dietary reactions or food exchange reactions, 
% whichever you use, are the same. If the upper bound is set to 0 or to a higher 
% amount than the lower bound (they are all negative values), the correct macronutrient 
% composition or metabolite composition will not be captured by the model as it 
% can choose to consume less. That will lead to results that only add new foods 
% or metabolites without telling you that it actually consumed less of a particular 
% item. To easily set the upper and lower bounds to the same value use:
% 
% for food item-constrained WBMs

model.ub(contains(model.rxns, 'Food_EX_')) = model.lb(contains(model.rxns, 'Food_EX_'));
%% 
% for flux-constrained WBMs

% Find all the dietary exchange reactions
dietaryMetExchanges = model.rxns(contains(model.rxns, 'Diet_EX_'));

% Remove the dietary exchange of macronutrients as we want those to be
% opened fully
dietaryMetExchanges(strcmp(dietaryMetExchanges, 'Diet_EX_energy[d]')) = [];
dietaryMetExchanges(strcmp(dietaryMetExchanges, 'Diet_EX_carbohydrate[d]')) = [];
dietaryMetExchanges(strcmp(dietaryMetExchanges, 'Diet_EX_protein[d]')) = [];
dietaryMetExchanges(strcmp(dietaryMetExchanges, 'Diet_EX_lipid[d]')) = [];
dietaryMetExchanges(strcmp(dietaryMetExchanges, 'Diet_EX_sugars[d]')) = [];
dietaryMetExchanges(strcmp(dietaryMetExchanges, 'Diet_EX_money[d]')) = [];

% Find the index in the model for the remaining dietary exchange reactions
rxnIdx = findRxnIDs(model, dietaryMetExchanges);

% Set the lower and upper bound to the same value
model.ub(rxnIdx) = model.lb(rxnIdx);
%% 
% Then we cann set the remaining variables

% Set the objective function to the whole body objective reaction. It does
% not matter if we maxisimise or minimise as the reaction is constrained to
% [1,1].
obj = 'Whole_body_objective_rxn';
objMinMax = 'max';

% Set the reactions of interest and if they have to minimised or maximised
rois = {'glc_D[bc]', 'dopa[csf]', 'Diet_EX_lipid[d]'};
roisMinMax = {'max', 'max', 'min'};

% We want to calculate database equivalent dietary changes
options.foodOrMets = 'Food';

% We will not weight our reaction of interest more then our dietary
% reactions
options.roiWeights=1*ones(1,length(rois));

%% 
% First we will show what happens when we do not use any additional dietary 
% constraints on the system.

 [newDietModel,pointsModel,roiFlux,pointsModelSln,menuChanges, macroChanges, roiChanges] = nutritionAlgorithmWBM(model,obj,objMinMax,rois,roisMinMax,options);
%% 
% As we can see from the printed output, the database equivalents that were 
% added were: Alcoholic beverages, cherries, egg whites, sorbitol, cod liver oil 
% and linseed oil and dried lactose powder. The total amount of food added to 
% the diet is ~810g, which on top of an already normal diet is quite some extra 
% food. When we look further in the dietary composition, 170g of egg white and 
% 141g of dried lactose powder does not seem appetising to eat and difficult to 
% incorporate in an already existing diet. This further asks for additional bounds 
% on food intake and macro-nutrient composition. Interestingly, we see an increase 
% of almost 30g of lipids in the diet, while we asked for the lipid conusmption 
% to be as small as possible. This is likely because we asked for the maximal 
% storage of glucose in the blood. That means that the points generated by adding 
% more glucose in the blood outweigh the points generated to by limiting lipid 
% consumption. This shows to highlight that various reactions of interest can 
% counteract each other as long if one reaction can generate vastly more points 
% than other reactions. A way to counteract this is by adjusting the reaction 
% weights which we show in a section further down.
% 
% We do see that the maximum storage of glucose is blood is increased with ~3000 
% mmol/person/day, the dopamine in the cerebral spine fluid with ~85 mmol/person/day 
% and consumed lipids with 33 g/person/day. The changes in diet, macronutrient 
% composition, and reaction of interest fluxes can be found in the output variables 
% dietChanges, macroChanges, and roiChanges, respectively.
%% 
% To obtain a more palatable dietary change we will now add additional constraints 
% to food consumed and macronutrient composition. 
% 
% From the diet analysis performed in step 3, we see that we have ~345g of carbohydrates, 
% ~45g of proteins, ~70g of lipids, ~195g of sugar and ~2200 kcal (found in the 
% macrosAsReported.csv table).  Depending on your modelling objectives, you can 
% use these values as a starting point to set constraints. If you want the diet 
% to remain in a similar range of macronutrient composition, we suggest to have 
% the constraints 10-20% of the original value to allow for some leeway. Otherwise, 
% if you want to drastically alter the composition, you can adjust the constraints 
% however you like it. You may also choose to adjust only one or two macronutrient 
% constraints. Just be aware that diet will only be as realistic as the constraints 
% you put on the system.
% 
% Here we will set the constraints to keep more or less the same dietary composition, 
% and we shall only add 150g of new database equivalents at maximum. We also demonstrate 
% here the capability to remove database equivalents from the analysis. We saw 
% in the previous calculation that we should add 130g of sorbitol to the diet, 
% an item that is not typically consumed in its raw form. Here we remove the item 
% with the option "removeFoodItems". To discard further items from analysis, add 
% new rows with ;.

% Let us clear the options from the previous run
clear options

% Set the new options for the new run

% We want to calculate database equivalent dietary changes
options.foodOrMets = 'Food';

% We will not weight our reaction of interest more than our dietary
% reactions
options.roiWeights=[1 1 1];
 
% Set the dietary limits
options.caloricRange=[1900 2300];
options.carbohydrateRange = [300 370];
options.lipidRange = [60 80];
options.proteinRange = [40 60];
options.sugarsRange = [170 210];

% Set the maximum amount of food addded
options.foodAddedLimit=150;

% Remove database equivalent sorbitol
options.removeFoodItem = {'1351', 'frida'};

% Run the nutrition algorithm again
[newDietModel,pointsModel,roiFlux,pointsModelSln,menuChanges, macroChanges, roiChanges] = nutritionAlgorithmWBM(model,obj,objMinMax,rois,roisMinMax,options);
%% 
% We can see that the dietary changes are different, although some items remained 
% the same. We now add ~150g of food to the diet while removing ~30g of food from 
% the diet. The removed food was likely removed to make space for the carbohydrate 
% macronutrient constraints. We can also see that, indeed, sorbitol does no longer 
% show up in the solution, as we removed it in the options. To double-check if 
% it would show up in the solution with these new constraints you can comment 
% out (put % in front of) the line where we set which database equivelants we 
% want to have removed and rerun. 
% 
% The main difference we see in our reactions of interest is for dopamine in 
% the cerebrospinal fluid, where we now only see an increase of ~9 mmol/person/day. 
% A possbile explanation is that the solution in the nutrition algorithm is biased 
% by how many points are generated by the reactions of interest. It sees that 
% more points can be achieved with glucose (up to ~3000 points), which is far 
% higher than for dopamine. This leads to the algorithm preferring dietary changes 
% to favour increased glucose in the blood, as this will garner more points. A 
% way to combat this bias is by adjusting the weight of the dopamine reaction 
% in roiWeights option to 10 or 100, so that every point made in that reaction 
% will be counted 10 or 100 times as much. This way the reactions of interest 
% can have the same influence on the solution.
% 
% If we look at the macronutrient distribution:

disp(macroChanges);
%% 
% We see indeed that all the new macronutrients are within the ranges we set. 
% It might slighty pass over or under the set bounds as we set the diet with a 
% 1% margin of the calculated optimal dietary changes. We also see that despite 
% asking to minimise the lipids in the diet, it still calculated that the optimal 
% solution would be to add the highstest allowed amount of lipids. This means 
% that its more important for the model to get the glucose maximised than it is 
% to minimise the lipid consumption. Again we change the roiWeights to give more 
% importance to minimising the lipid content in the diet to limit the effect glucose 
% has on the solution.
% 
% To give the diets an addtional layer of realism, we can add on the price. 
% This can be done through the options variable:
% 
% options.addPrice: a nx3 cell array with the first column the database equivalent 
% ID, the second column the name of the database, and in the third column the 
% price (any currency) associated with that database equivalent. This allows for 
% optimising the cost of a diet, but only if sufficient information is available.
% 
% Important is that you remove all other database equivalents that you do not 
% have price information for. Otherwise the algorithm will include those items 
% as they "do not cost anything". Note that this will be a time-intensive option 
% as you will have to link price to the various database items of interest.
%
