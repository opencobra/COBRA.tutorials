%% Creation and simulation of personalized microbiota models through metagenomic data integration
%% Author: Federico Baldini, Molecular Systems Physiology Group, University of Luxembourg.
%% INTRODUCTION
% This tutorial shows the steps that MgPipe automatically performs to create 
% and simulate personalized microbiota models trough metagenomic data integration. 
% Please note that this tutorial uses as an example a small dataset (4 columns 
% and 30 rows) with the purpose of demonstrating the functionalities of the pipeline. 
% We recommend using high-performance computing clusters when assembling and simulating 
% from bigger datasets. 
% 
% The pipeline is divided into 3 parts:
% 
% # *[PART 1]* Analysis of individuals' specific microbes abundances is computed. 
% Individuals' metabolic diversity in relation to microbiota size and disease 
% presence, as well as, classical multidimensional scaling (PCoA) on individuals' 
% reaction repertoire are examples.
% # *[PART 2]*: 1 Constructing a global metabolic model (setup) containing all 
% the microbes listed in the study. 2 Building individuals' specific models integrating 
% abundance data retrieved from metagenomics. For each organism, reactions are 
% coupled to their objective function. 
% # *[PART 3]* A specific range of growth is imposed for each microbiota model 
% and Simulations under specific diet regimes are carried. Set of standard analysis 
% to apply to the personalized models. PCA of computed MNPCs of individuals as 
% for example.
%% USAGE
% Normally, once provided all the input variables in the driver (StartMgPipe), 
% the only action required is to run the driver itself. However, for this tutorial, 
% we will disable the autorun functionality and compute each section manually. 
%% DRIVER
% This file has to be modified by the user to launch the pipeline and to define 
% inputs and outputs files and locations. 
%% Initialize the COBRA Toolbox
initCobraToolbox
%% Prepare input data and models
% We first set the paths to input and output files
initCobraToolbox(false); % false, as we don't want to update
%%
% We will use the AGORA resource (Magnusdottir et al., Nat Biotechnol. 2017 
% Jan;35(1):81-89) in this tutorial. AGORA version 1.02 is available at
% www.vmh.life. Download AGORA and place the models into a folder.
system('curl -O https://www.vmh.life/files/reconstructions/AGORA/1.02/Agora-1.02.zip')
unzip('Agora-1.02.zip','AGORA')
modPath = [tutorialPath filesep 'AGORA' filesep 'mat'];
% path where to save results
mkdir('results');
resPath = [tutorialPath filesep 'results'];
%%
% path to and name of the file with dietary information. Here, 
% we will use an "Average European" diet that is located in the 
% DietImplementation folder.
global CBTDIR
dietFilePath=[CBTDIR filesep 'papers' filesep '2018_microbiomeModelingToolbox' filesep 'resources' filesep 'AverageEuropeanDiet'];
%% 
% Then we set the path and the name of the file from which to load the abundances. 
% For this tutorial, to reduce the time of computations, we will use a reduced 
% version of the example file (normCoverageReduced.csv) provided in the folder 
% Resources: only 4 individuals and 30 strains will be considered. Plese, note 
% that abundances are normalized to a total sum of one. 
%%
abunFilePath=[CBTDIR filesep 'tutorials' filesep 'analysis' filesep 'microbiomeModelingToolbox' filesep 'normCoverageReduced.csv'];
%% 
% Next inputs will define:
% 
% # name of the objective function of organisms
% # format to use to save images
% # number of cores to use for the pipeline execution 
% # if to enable automatic detection and correction of possible bugs
% # if to enable compatibility mode 
% # if stratification criteria are available
% # if to simulate also a rich diet
% # if to use an external solver and save models with diet
% # the type of FVA function to use to solve 
% 
% The following setting should work for almost any system, but please check 
% carefully to be sure these options are valid for you. A more detailed description 
% of these variables is available in the documentation. 
% 
% The same inputs need to be set in the driver file StartMgPipe when running 
% mgPipe outside of this tutorial or directly in the "initMgPipe" function.
%%
% name of the objective function of organisms

% if outputs in open formats should be produced for each section

% to enable also rich diet simulations

% if to use an external solver and save models with diet
extSolve = false; 

% the type of FVA function to use to solve
fvaType = true;

% to turn off the autorun to be able to manually execute each part of the pipeline
autorun = false;

%% PIPELINE: [PART 1]
% The number of organisms, their names, the number of samples and their identifiers 
% are automatically detected from the input file. 
%%
[patNumb, sampName, strains] = getIndividualSizeName(abunFilePath)

end
%% 
% In case PART 1 was not computed we will compute it now. We will first 
% load the models and create a cell array containing them. This cell array will 
% be used as input by many functions in the pipeline. Any possible constraint 
% from each model reactions will be removed. Moreover we will run and subsequentially 
% plot the results of some analysis that are computed. The main outputs are:
% 
% # *Metabolic diversity* The number of mapped organisms for each individual 
% compared to the total number of unique reactions (extrapolated by the number 
% of reactions of each organism).Please, note that bigger circles with a number 
% inside represent overlapping individuals for metabolic diversity. 
% # *Classical multidimensional scaling of each individual reactions repertoire*
% 
% Other outputs computed during this phase are saved together with the previous 
% ones into the *.mat* file called *mapInfo.mat*. If the *compMod* option is enabled 
% (disabled here and by default in the *mgPipe* pipeline) these results are outputted 
% as different *.csv* files. For simplicity reasons we will not discuss these 
% additional outputs in this tutorial: for a description of them, please refer 
% to the documentation.

% and saved are:
% 
% # *ID* a vector containing the names of metabolites for which FVA of exchange 
% reactions was computed
% # *fvaCt* a cell array containing min flux trough uptake and max trough secretion 
% exchanges (later used for computing NMPCs)
% # *nsCT* a cell array containing max flux trough uptake and min trough secretion 
% exchanges
% # *presol* an array containing the value of objectives for each microbiota 
% model with rich and selected diet
% # *inFesMat* cell array containing the names of the microbiota models that 
% reported an infeasible status when solved for their objective

% Finally, NMPCs (net maximal production capability) are computed in a metabolite 
% resolved manner and saved in a comma delimited file in the results folder. NMPCs 
% indicate the maximal production of each metabolite and are computed as the absolute 
% value of the sum of the maximal secretion flux with the maximal uptake flux. 
% The similarity of metabolic profiles (using the different NMPCs as features) 
% between individuals is also evaluated with classical multidimensional scaling.

%% 
% Additionally, it is possible to retrieve and export, comprehensively, 
% all the results (fluxes) computed during the simulations for a specified diet. 
% Since FVA is computed on diet and fecal exchanges, every metabolite will have 
% four different values for each individual, values corresponding min and max 
% of uptake and secretion.
