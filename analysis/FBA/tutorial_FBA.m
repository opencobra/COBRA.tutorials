%% INTRODUCTION
% In this tutorial, Flux Balance Analysis (FBA) is introduced using the E. coli 
% core model, with functions in the COBRA Toolbox v3.0 [2].  
% 
% Flux balance analysis is a solution to the optimisation problem
% 
% $$\begin{array}{ll}\textrm{max} & c^{T}v\\\text{s.t.} & Sv=b\\ & l\leq v\leq 
% u\end{array}\end{equation}$$
% 
% where $c$ is a vector of linear objective coefficients, $S$ is an m times 
% n matrix of stoichiometric coefficients for m molecular species involved in 
% n reactions. $l\;\textrm{and}\;u\;$are n times 1 vectors that are the lower 
% and upper bounds on the n times 1 variable vector $v\;$of reaction rates (fluxes). 
% The optimal objective value is $c^{T}v^{\star}$  is always unique, but the optimal 
% vector $v^{\star}$ is usually not unique.
% 
% In summary, the data is {c,S,l,u} and the variable being optimised is v.

%% MATERIALS - EQUIPMENT SETUP
% Please ensure that all the required dependencies (e.g. , |git| and |curl|) 
% of The COBRA Toolbox have been properly installed by following the installation 
% guide <https://opencobra.github.io/cobratoolbox/stable/installation.html here>. 
% Please ensure that the COBRA Toolbox has been initialised (tutorial_initialize.mlx) 
% and verify that the pre-packaged LP and QP solvers are functional (tutorial_verify.mlx).
%% PROCEDURE
%% Load E. coli core model
% The most appropriate way to load a model into The COBRA Toolbox is to use 
% the |readCbModel| function. 

fileName = 'ecoli_core_model.mat';
if ~exist('modelOri','var')
    modelOri = readCbModel(fileName);
end
%backward compatibility with primer requires relaxation of upper bound on
%ATPM
modelOri = changeRxnBounds(modelOri,'ATPM',1000,'u');
model = modelOri;

% 
% The meaning of each field in a standard model is defined in the <https://github.com/opencobra/cobratoolbox/blob/master/docs/source/notes/COBRAModelFields.md 
% standard COBRA model field definition>.
% 
% In general, the following fields should always be present: 
%% 
% * *S*, the stoichiometric matrix
% * *mets*, the identifiers of the metabolites
% * *b*, Accumulation (positive) or depletion (negative) of the corresponding 
% metabolites. 0 Indicates no concentration change.
% * *csense*, indicator whether the b vector is a lower bound ('G'), upper bound 
% ('L'), or hard constraint 'E' for the metabolites.
% * *rxns*, the identifiers of the reactions
% * *lb*, the lower bounds of the reactions
% * *ub*, the upper bounds of the reactions
% * *c*, the linear objective
% * *genes*, the list of genes in your model 
% * *rules*, the Gene-protein-reaction rules in a computer readable format present 
% in your model.
% * *osenseStr*, the objective sense either |'max'| for maximisation or |'min'| 
% for minimisation
%% Checking the non-trivial constraints on a model
% What are the default constraints on the model? 
% Hint: |printConstraints|

printConstraints(model,-1000,1000)
%% Example 1: Calculating growth rates
% Growth of E. coli on glucose can be simulated under aerobic conditions.  
% What is the growth rate of _E. coli_ on glucose (uptake rate = 18.5 mmol/gDW/h) under aerobic and anaerobic conditions?  
% Hint: |changeRxnBounds|, |changeObjective|, |optimizeCbModel|, |printFluxVector|
% To set the maximum glucose uptake rate to 18.5 mmol gDW-1 hr-1 (millimoles 
% per gram dry cell weight per hour, the default flux units used in the COBRA 
% Toolbox), enter:

model = changeRxnBounds(model,'EX_glc(e)',-18.5,'l');
%% 
% This changes the lower bound ('l') of the glucose exchange reaction to -18.5, 
% a biologically realistic uptake rate.  By convention, exchange reactions are 
% written as export reactions (e.g. ‘glc[e] <==>’), so import of a metabolite 
% is a negative flux.  
% 
% To allow unlimited oxygen uptake, enter:

model = changeRxnBounds(model,'EX_o2(e)',-1000,'l');
%% 
% By setting the lower bound of the oxygen uptake reaction to such a large number, 
% it is practically unbounded.  Next, to ensure that the biomass reaction is set 
% as the objective function, enter:

model = changeObjective(model,'Biomass_Ecoli_core_N(w/GAM)-Nmet2');
%% 
% The default behaviour of the function |optimizeCbModel| is to conduct flux 
% balance analysis on a |model| structure.  This function is the most powerful 
% function in the COBRA toolbox and has many optional inputs and outputs but for 
% a straightforward flux balance analysis, the following fields of a model are 
% the required input:

%    model:             (the following fields are required - others can be supplied)
%
%                         * S  - `m x 1` Stoichiometric matrix
%                         * c  - `n x 1` Linear objective coefficients
%                         * lb - `n x 1` Lower bounds
%                         * ub - `n x 1` Upper bounds
%% 
% To perform FBA with maximization of the biomass reaction as the objective, 
% enter:

FBAsolution = optimizeCbModel(model,'max')
% What are the main fields to check in the FBAsolution structure?
% Hint: |help optimizeCbModel|
% There are many outputs fields in the |FBAsolution| structure, but the key 
% ones for any FBA solution are

%    solution:       solution object:
%             * f - Objective value
%             * v - Reaction rates (Optimal primal variable, legacy FBAsolution.x)
%             * stat - Solver status in standardized form
%% 
% FBAsolution.f  gives the value of the objective function, which should be 
% 1.6531 mmol gDW-1 hr-1 

FBAsolution.f
%% 
% This is the same as 

model.c'*FBAsolution.v
%% 
% This means that the model predicts a growth rate of 1.6531 hr-1.  Inspection 
% of the flux distribution vector FBAsolution.v shows that there is high flux 
% in the glycolysis, pentose phosphate, TCA cycle, and oxidative phosphorylation 
% pathways, and that no organic by-products are secreted (Figure 2a).
% 
% |FBAsolution.v| gives the optimal flux vector

FBAsolution.v
%% 
% Inspection of the flux distribution is more convenient with the |printFluxVector| 
% function

fluxData = FBAsolution.v;
nonZeroFlag = 1;
printFluxVector(model, fluxData, nonZeroFlag)
% What does FBAsolution.stat mean?
% 
%% Example 2: Display an optimal flux vector on a metabolic map
% Which reactions/pathways are in use (look at the flux vector and flux map)?
% Hint: |drawFlux|

outputFormatOK = changeCbMapOutput('matlab');
map=readCbMap('ecoli_core_map');
options.zeroFluxWidth = 0.1;
options.rxnDirMultiplier = 10;
drawFlux(map, model, FBAsolution.v, options);
%% Example 3:  Anerobic growth
% Growth of E. coli on glucose can be simulated under anaerobic conditions.  
% What is the optimal growth rate under anaerobic conditions?
% Hint: changeRxnBounds
% Next, the same simulation is performed under anaerobic conditions.  With the 
% same model:

model = changeRxnBounds(model,'EX_o2(e)',0,'l');
%% 
% The lower bound of the oxygen exchange reaction is now 0, so oxygen may not 
% enter the system.  When optimizeCbModel is used as before, the resulting growth 
% rate is now much lower, 0.4706 hr-1.  

FBAsolution2 = optimizeCbModel(model,'max');
FBAsolution2.f
% What reactions of oxidative phosphorylation are active in anaerobic conditions?
% Hint: |printFluxVector| |drawFlux|
% The flux distribution shows that oxidative phosphorylation is not used in 
% these conditions, and that acetate, formate, and ethanol are produced by fermentation 
% pathways (Figure 2b). Inspection of both flux vectors for comparison:

fluxData = [FBAsolution.v,FBAsolution2.v];
nonZeroFlag = 1;
excFlag = 1;
printFluxVector(model, fluxData, nonZeroFlag, excFlag)
drawFlux(map, model, FBAsolution2.v, options);
%% 
% 
% 
% *Figure 2*  Flux vectors computed by FBA can be visualized on network maps.  
% In these two examples, the thick blue arrows represent reactions carrying flux, 
% and the thin black arrows represent unused reactions.  These maps show the state 
% of the E. coli core model with maximum growth rate as the objective (Z) under 
% aerobic (a) and anaerobic (b) conditions.  Reactions that are in use have thick 
% blue arrows, while reactions that carry 0 flux have thin black arrows. The metabolic 
% pathways shown in these maps are glycolysis (Glyc), pentose phosphate pathway 
% (PPP), TCA cycle (TCA), oxidative phosphorylation (OxP), anaplerotic reactions 
% (Ana), and fermentation pathways (Ferm). 
%% Example 4:  Growth on alternate substrates
% Just as FBA was used to calculate growth rates of E. coli on glucose, it can 
% also be used to simulate growth on other substrates.  The core E. coli model 
% contains exchange reactions for 13 different organic compounds, each of which 
% can be used as the sole carbon source under aerobic conditions. 
% What is the growth rate of _E. coli_ on succinate?
% Hint: |changeRxnBounds|
% Before trying out new boundary conditions on a model, make sure one's starting 
% point is appropriate.

model = modelOri;
%% 
% For example, to simulate growth on succinate instead of glucose, first use 
% the changeRxnBounds function to set the lower bound of the glucose exchange 
% reaction (EX_glc(e)) to 0.  

model = changeRxnBounds(model,'EX_glc(e)',0,'l');
%% 
% Then use changeRxnBounds to set the lower bound of the succinate exchange 
% reaction (EX_succ(e)) to -20 mmol gDW-1 hr-1 (an arbitrary uptake rate).  

model = changeRxnBounds(model,'EX_succ(e)',-20,'l');
%% 
% As in the glucose examples, make sure that the biomass reaction is set as 
% the objective (the function checkObjective can be used to identify the objective 
% reaction(s)), 

checkObjective(model);
%% 
% Use optimizeCbModel to perform FBA, then the growth rate, given by FBAsolution.f, 
% will be 0.8401 hr-1. 

FBAsolution = optimizeCbModel(model,'max');
FBAsolution.f
%% 
% Growth can also be simulated under anaerobic conditions with any substrate 
% by using changeRxnBounds to set the lower bound of the oxygen exchange reaction 
% (EX_o2(e)) to 0 mmol gDW-1 hr-1, so no oxygen can enter the system.  When this 
% constraint is applied and succinate is the only organic substrate, optimizeCbModel 
% returns a growth rate of 0 hr-1

model = changeRxnBounds(model,'EX_o2(e)',0,'l');
FBAsolution = optimizeCbModel(model,'max');
FBAsolution.f
%% 
% In this case, FBA predicts that growth is not possible on succinate under 
% anaerobic conditions.  Because the maximum amount of ATP that can be produced 
% from this amount of succinate is less than the minimum bound of 8.39 mmol gDW-1 
% hr 1 of the ATP maintenance reaction, ATPM, there is no feasible solution.
%% TROUBLESHOOTING
% Although it does not happen often, there are many reasons why an FBA problem 
% might not solve, so they are divided into three categories. 

%      solution.stat - Solver status in standardized form:
%                      * `-1` - No solution reported (timelimit, numerical problem etc)
%                      * `1` - Optimal solution
%                      * `2` - Unbounded solution
%                      * `0` - Infeasible
%% 
% |solution.stat == 0|  means that the problem is overconstrainted and no feasible 
% flux vector v exists. The constraints need to be relaxed before the problem 
% will solve. See tutorial_relaxedFBA.mlx
% 
% |solution.stat = 2|  means that the problem is underconstrained to the extent 
% that the possible optimal value of the objective is unbounded, that is infinity, 
% or minus infinity. This means that extra constraints need to be added, e.g., 
% lower and upper bounds on the reaction rates.
% 
% |solution.stat = 1|  means that the problem is more complicated than either 
% of the above. It could be that the problem does, in principle, have a solution, 
% but that the current solver cannot find one, so an industrial quality solver 
% should be tested, e.g., gurobi. It could also mean that the FBA problem is poorly 
% scaled so there are numerical problems solving it, or it could also be just 
% slightly infeasible, in which case a higher precision solver will be required 
% to solve the problem, e.g., a quadruple precision solver. The way each solver 
% reports the nature of the problem varies between solvers, so checking |solution.origStat| 
% against the documentation that comes with each solver is necessary to figure 
% out what the potential solution is.

%    solution.stat - Solver status in standardized form:
%                      * `-1` - No solution reported (timelimit, numerical problem etc)
%                      * `1` - Optimal solution
%                      * `2` - Unbounded solution
%                      * `0` - Infeasible
