%% INTRODUCTION
% Visualisation of data on top of biochemical pathways is an important tool 
% for interpreting the results of constrained-based modeling. It can be an invaluable 
% aid for developing an understanding of the biological meaning implied by a prediction. 
% Biochemical network maps permit the visual integration of model predictions 
% with the underlying biochemical context. Patterns that are very difficult to 
% appreciate in a vector can often be much better appreciated by studying a generic 
% map contextualised with model predictions. Genome-scale biochemical network 
% visualisation is particularly demanding. No currently available software satisfies 
% all of the requirements that might be desired for visualisation of predictions 
% from genome-scale models.
% 
% Here we present a tool for the visualisation of computational predictions 
% from The Constraint-based Reconstruction and Analysis Toolbox (COBRA Toolbox) 
% [1] to available metabolic maps developed in CellDesigner [2].
% 
% Several maps are used in this tutorial for illustration: (i) a comprehensive 
% mitochondrial metabolic map compassing 1263 metabolic reactions extracted from 
% the latest version of the human cellular metabolism, Recon 3D [3]. (ii) Small 
% map contaning Glycolisis and TCA for faster testing and manipulation. (iii) 
% A mitochondria map combining metabolic pathways with protein-protein interactions 
% (PPI). Proteins and complexes implicated in mitochondrial reactions have been 
% extracted from the Parkinson Disease map (PDMap) [4].
% 
% In this tutorial, manipulation of CellDesgner maps in COBRA toolbox and 
% visualising model predictions is explained. The main covered topics are:
% 
% * Loading metabolic models and models containing both metabolic and regulatory 
% networks constructed in CellDesigner 
% * Detection and correction of discrepancies between map and models
% * Basic map manipulation (change color and size of nodes and reactions, directionality 
% of reactions, reaction types...) 
% * Basic model analysis visualisation (visualisation of Flux Balance Analysis) 
%% EQUIPMENT SETUP 
% To visualise the metabolic maps it is necessary to obtain the version 4.4 
% of CellDesigner. This software can be freely downloaded from: 
% 
% <http://www.celldesigner.org/download.html http://www.celldesigner.org/download.html>
%% Initialise The Cobra Toolbox and set the solver. 
% If needed, initialise the cobra toolbox.
%%
initCobraToolbox(false) no need to update
%% 
% The present tutorial can run with glpk package, which does not require 
% additional installation and configuration. Although, for the analysis of large 
% models it is recommended to use the GUROBI package.

%% Model setup. 
% In this tutorial, we provided two exclusive metabolic models. A mitochondrial 
% model and a small metabolic model specific for Glycolysis and Citric acid cycle. 
% Both models were extracted from the latest version of the database of the human 
% cellular metabolism, Recon 3D [3]. For extra information about metabolites structures 
% and reactions, and to download the latest COBRA model releases, visit the Virtual 
% Metabolic Human database (VMH, <https://vmh.life). https://vmh.life).> 
% 
% Before proceeding with the simulations, load the model into the workspace: 

modelFileName = 'Recon2.0model.mat';
modelDirectory = getDistributedModelFolder(modelFileName);
modelFileName = [modelDirectory filesep modelFileName];
model = readCbModel(modelFileName);
%% PROCEDURE
% Aforementioned, two kind of maps will be used along the tutorial. Depending 
% on the nature of the species in the map (metabolites or proteins), different 
% functions will be used to import the XML file produced in CellDesigner into 
% MATLAB.
%% 1. Import a CellDesigner XML file to MATLAB environment
%% A) Parse a Metabolic map
% The |transformXML2Map| function parses an XML file from Cell Designer (CD) 
% into a Matlab structure. This structure is organised similarly to the structure 
% found in the COnstraint-Base and Reconstruction Analysis (COBRA) models.
% 
% Load two types of metabolic maps: 
% 
% # A small metabolic model representative of glycolysis and citric acid cycle. 
% # A bigger metabolic map representative of the mitochondrial metabolism. 
%%
[xmlGly, mapGly] = transformXML2Map('glycolysisAndTCA.xml');
[xmlMitoMetab, mapMitoMetab] = ...
    transformXML2Map('metabolicMitochondria.xml');
%% 
% 
% 
% This function internally calls the function |xml2struct| which parses the 
% XML file to a general Matlab structure. Afterwards, this general structure is 
% reorganised. Due to this internal function, there are two outputs: "|xml|" is 
% the general Matlab structure obtain from |xml2struct| function, whereas "|map|" 
% is the desired final structure that could be later manipulated.
%% B) Parse a Metabolic map combined with Protein-Protein-Interactions (PPI)
% The |transformFullXML2Map| function parses an XML file from Cell Designer 
% (CD) into a Matlab structure. The resultant structure contains all the information 
% commonly stored in a metabolic map, plus extra information corresponding to 
% proteins and complexes.
%%
[xmlPPI, mapPPI] = transformFullXML2Map('metabolicPPIMitochondria.xml');
%% 
% _*NOTE! *The XML file to be parsed must be in the current folder in MATLAB 
% when executing the function._
% 
% *TIMING*
% 
% The time to parse a Cell Designer map from a XML file to a MATLAB structure 
% or vice-versa depends on the size of the map, and can vary from seconds to minutes.
%% TROUBLESHOOTING (Control error check)
% In order to properly visualise the modeling obtained during model analysis, 
% the map used for the visualisation must match with the model under study. Errors 
% in reaction or metabolite names are highly common, leading to mismatches and 
% therefore wrong representation of data.
% 
% In order to ensure a proper visualisation of the outputs coming from model 
% analysis, a control error check is highly recommended.
% 
% The function |checkCDerrors| gives four outputs summarising all possible 
% discrepancies between model and map.

[diffReactions, diffMetabolites, diffReversibility, diffFormula] = ...
    checkCDerrors(mapGly, model);
%% 
% 
% 
% Four outputs are obtained from this function:
% 
% "|diffReactions|" summarises present and absent reactions between model 
% and map.
% 
% "|diffMetabolites|" summarises present and absent metabolites. 
% 
% _*NOTE!* Note that having more metabolites and reactions in the COBRA model 
% is normal since the model can contain more elements than the map. From the other 
% hand, the map should only contain elements present in the model._
% 
%  "|diffReversibility|" summarises discrepancies in defining the reversibility 
% of reactions.
% 
% The last output "|diffFormula"| summarises discrepancies in reactions formulae 
% (kinetic rates) and also lists duplicated reactions.
% 
% Some functions have been developed to modify attributes in the map automatically 
% from MATLAB:  
% 
% * Errors in reaction names can be manually corrected in the Matlab structure 
% with the function |correctRxnNameCD|. In the example one of the most common 
% errors is shown: spaces in names are identified as errors.
%%
correctRxns = diffReactions.extraRxnModel;
mapGlyCorrected = correctRxnNameCD(mapGly, ...
    diffReactions, correctRxns);
%% 
% * Errors in metabolites can be corrected manually or automatically by the 
% function |correctErrorMets| by giving a list of correct metabolite names. In 
% the example, |"diffMetabolites.extraMetsModel"| correspond to the correct name 
% of wrong metabolites in "|diffMetabolites.extraMetsMap"|.
%%
correctMets = diffMetabolites.extraMetsModel;
mapGlyCorrected = correctMetNameCD(mapGlyCorrected, ...
    diffMetabolites, correctMets);
%% 
% * Two functions can be used to solve errors in defining the reaction reversibility. 
% The functions |transformToReversibleMap| and |transformToIrreversibleMap|, modify 
% the reversibility of reactions in the map. Reaction lists obtained from "|diffReversibility"| 
% can be used as an input of the next functions.
% 
% To correct a reversible reaction in the map, irreversible in the model. 
%%
mapGlyCorrected = transformToIrreversibleMap(mapGlyCorrected, ...
    diffReversibility.wrongReversibleRxnsMap);
%% 
% To correct a irreversible reaction in the map, reversible in the model. 

mapGlyCorrected = transformToReversibleMap(mapGlyCorrected, ...
    diffReversibility.wrongIrreversibleRxnsMap);
%% 
% _*NOTE!* Reversibility errors due to base direction of the arrow can only 
% be manually fixed in Cell designer. When creating a "reversible" reaction in 
% CellDesigner, first a "irreverisble" reaction is created and has a particular 
% direction. This "base" direction can be interpreted as an error as it dictates 
% what metabolites are reactants or products._
% 
% In order to check the reaction reversibility, reaction formulae can be 
% printed from the map and model using different functions.

wrongFormula = mapFormula(mapGly, ...
    diffReversibility.wrongIrreversibleRxnsMap);
%% 
% Print the same formula in the model to see the corrected formula: 

rightFormula = printRxnFormula(model, ...
    diffReversibility.wrongIrreversibleRxnsMap);
%% 
% Print reaction formula from the corrected file mapGlyCorrected: 

correctedFormula = mapFormula(mapGlyCorrected, ...
    diffReversibility.wrongIrreversibleRxnsMap);
%% 
% * *Anticipated results*
% 
% Before correcting formula's errors, run the control check again. Probably 
% several errors in the output "|diffFormula|" have already been taken care of 
% when correcting previous outputs.

[diffReactions, diffMetabolites, diffReversibility, diffFormula] = ...
    checkCDerrors(mapGlyCorrected,model);
%% 
% _*NOTE!* Formula errors can only be manually corrected from the XML file 
% in Cell designer._
%% 2. Export the modified MATLAB structure to CellDesigner XML file
% In order to save the corrections previously made into an XML file, two functions 
% are available depending on the MATLAB structure used.
%% A) Parse a metabolic MATLAB structure
% The "|transformMap2XML|" function parsed a MATLAB structure (from a simple 
% metabolic map) into a XML file.  In order to save the previous corrections made.
%%
transformMap2XML(xmlGly, ...
    mapGlyCorrected,'GlycolysisAndTCACorrected.xml');
%% B) Parse a metabolic MATLAB structure combined with PPI
% As in the parsing from XML to a MATLAB structure, a different function will 
% be used when proteins and complexes are present in the map "|transformFullMap2XML|".
%% Visualisation of Metabolic networks
%% EQUIPMENT SETUP
% CellDesigner uses the HTML-based colour format. This information if used to 
% modify colors of pathways of interest such as Fluxes. The function |createColorsMap| 
% contains all references for different colours HTML code to be directly recognised 
% in Cell Designer and associated to a specific name. Therefore, users wont need 
% to give a code but a colour name in capitals (143 colors are recognized).
%%
% Check the list of available colours to use in Cell designer (retrieve 143 colors) 
% open createColorsMap.m
%% 
%% PROCEDURE
% Several modification can be done in the maps. All attributes can be easily 
% reached in the COBRA type MATLAB structure and modified. The colour, name, type 
% and size of nodes can be easily modified from MATLAB instead of doing it manually 
% in CellDesigner. Furthermore, other attributes such as reaction type or reversibility 
% (previously mentioned) can also be modified.
%% *1. Change reaction colour and width*
% The function |changeRxnColorAndWidth| modifies the width and colour of reactions 
% provided in the form of a list of names.
% 
% * *Anticipated results*
% 
% All reactions present in the map can be coloured if the list given is extracted 
% from the map and not from the model. See the next example: 
% 
% In the example, all reactions in the map will be coloured as Light-salmon 
% and have a width of 10 (width=1 by default). Furthermore, the newly generated 
% map will be transformed to be opened in CD.
%%
mapGlyColoured = changeRxnColorAndWidth(mapGlyCorrected, ...
    mapGlyCorrected.rxnName, 'LIGHTSALMON',10);
transformMap2XML(xmlGly, mapGlyColoured,'mapGlyRxnColoured.xml');
%% 
% 
% 
% _*NOTE! *in this example all reactions present in the map are being given 
% as input list. However, this list can contain a set of reactions given by the 
% user._
%% 2. Add colour to metabolites
% The function |addColourNode| adds colour to all nodes linked to a specific 
% list of reactions. Taking as an example the previous list we can modify the 
% colour of all those nodes in the map in Light-steel-blue. Furthermore, the newly 
% generated map will be transformed into a XML file.
%%
mapGlyColouredNodes = addColourNode(mapGlyColoured, ...
    mapGlyColoured.rxnName, 'LIGHTSTEELBLUE');
transformMap2XML(xmlGly, ...
    mapGlyColouredNodes,'mapGlyMetColoured.xml');
%% 
% 
%% *3. Changing the colour of individual metabolite*
% It is possible to change the colour of specific metabolites in the map given 
% a list of metabolite names. Here for example we want to visualise where ATP 
% and ADP appear in order to give a global visual image of where energy is being 
% produced and consumed.
% 
% First, for an easier visualisation all metabolites present in the map will 
% be coloured in white. Afterwards, selected metabolites "mitochondrial ATP and 
% ADP" will be coloured in Red. Finally, the newly generated map will be transformed 
% into a XML file. 
%%
mapATPADP = changeMetColor(mapGly, ...
    mapGly.specName, 'WHITE'); % Change the colour of all nodes in the map to white
mapATPADP = changeMetColor(mapATPADP, ...
    {'atp[m]'}, 'RED'); % Change specifically the colour of ATP and ADP
mapATPADP = changeMetColor(mapATPADP, {'adp[m]'}, 'RED');

transformMap2XML(xmlGly, mapATPADP, 'mapATPADPColoured.xml');
%% 
% 
% 
% Furthermore, we can also color reactions linked to specific metabolites 
% by combining functions for the COBRA models and Visualisation. The function 
% |findRxnsFromMets |identify all reactions containing specific metabolites. Here 
% we want to find reactions containing "mitochondrial ATP and ADP", and colour 
% these reactions in "aquamarine".  Moreover,the newly generated map will be transformed 
% into a XML file.

rxnsATPADP = findRxnsFromMets(model,{'atp[m]';'adp[m]'});
mapATPADPRxns = changeRxnColorAndWidth(mapATPADP, ...
    rxnsATPADP, 'AQUAMARINE' ,10);

transformMap2XML(xmlGly, mapATPADPRxns, 'mapATPADPRxnsColoured.xml');
%% 
% 
% 
% _*NOTE! *This funtion colors a list of specific metabolites whereas the 
% function |addColourNode |color all nodes linked to a specific list of reactions._
% 
% This combination of specific metabolites and reactions can be also directly 
% done using the function |modifyReactionsMetabolites| mentioned before. However, 
% using the functions described in this section, one can colour metabolites associated 
% to the same reaction and chose colours in different ways.
